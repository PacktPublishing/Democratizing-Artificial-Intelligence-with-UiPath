Very Negative,"This model may be ok for sedentary types, but I'm active and get around alot in my job - consistently found these stockings rolled up down by my ankles! Not Good!! Solution: go with the standard compression stocking, 20-30, stock #114622. Excellent support, stays up and gives me what I need. Both pair of these also tore as I struggled to pull them up all the time. Good riddance/bad investment!"
Positive,"This is a fast read filled with unexpected humour and profound insights into the art of politics and policy. In brief, it is sly, wry, and wise."
Negative,"I bought one of these chargers..the instructions say the lights stay on while the battery charges...true. The instructions doNT say the lights turn off when its done. Which is also true. 24 hours of charging and the lights stay on. I returned it thinking I had a bad unit.The new one did the same thing. I just kept it since it does charge...but the lights are useless since they seem to always stay on. It's a ""backup"" charger for when I manage to drain all my AAs but I wouldn't want this as my only charger."
Negative,"I was excited to find a book ostensibly about Muslim feminism, but this volume did not live up to the expectations.One essay, among other things, describes the veil as potentially liberating. It doesn't begin to explain how or why.Another, on Muslim women in Cape Town, claims that Muslim women there are separate but ""more than equal."" Gee whiz, what a disappointment.I had expected and hoped for at least one Muslim feminist condemnation of gender apartheid. But there is not a single one in the book.I'm surprised it didn't have an essay extolling the virtues of female genital mutilation.--Alyssa A. Lappen"
Negative,"I am a big JVC fan, but I do not like this model, I was suspiscious when I saw several units in the return section of the store. I bought one anyway (new) and must say I am not happy. The unit sends out clicks to the receiver once in a while, the transition between scenes is not always smooth,(like a little pause) and while it is still fairly new I can't get any DVD,CD or even a DVD headcleaner to work. All I get is a ""incorrect disc"" message."
Negative,"I love the style of this, but after a couple years, the DVD is giving me problems. It doesn't even work anymore and I use my broken PS2 Now. I wouldn't recommend this, I'm just going to upgrade to a recorder now. I wish it would work but I guess i'm giving up on JVC. I really did like this one... before it stopped working. The dvd player gave me problems probably after a year of having it."
Negative,"I cannot scroll through a DVD menu that is set up vertically. The triangle keys will only select horizontally. So I cannot select anything on most DVD's besides play. No special features, no language select, nothing, just play."
Neutral,"This movie with all of its animals really keeps my grandson occupied when I'm babysitting. He loves watching it over and over again. I can get so much accomplished before he gets bored with it. So, it is worth the money! As a matter of fact, I'm buying one for his house, his 3 y/o cousins' and my house. We're saying goodbye to Netflix! Way to go Amazon!!Gammy"
Very Positive,"I found a copy of this cookbook at a local used book store and mixed up a sourdough starter the following day. It was bubbling away the next morning and I can't wait to try it in a few more days...The directions in this book are simple to follow. The anecdotes and history provided are entertaining. The recipes all sound delicious! I'll be working my way through many of these, starting of course with the sourdough hotcakes and bread. The handwritten format just adds to the charm of the book. If you're interested in learning to make sourdoughs, this book will give you all the information you'll need."
Neutral,"The book is a basic ""how to"" book for using sourdough. The author obviously has lots of experience cooking with a sourdough starter.I would have loved more recipes, but I did go search for my more on the internet."
Neutral,"I compared a few different flat panels with review before I narrowed down my pick, which ended up with the Sylvania as over well liked. The picture got great reviews which yes it does have a good picture to look at but there are other important qualities you enjoy that makes viewing tv all the better. For example: sound... how was that forgotten?In this flat panel, it was. What a disappointment. If this is consider stereo than why does it sound like its coming from a tin can with no base at all. Then too boot, if you play the dvd, the sound drops and you have to really turn up the volume to hear.I want the whole package deal: space saving, great picture, and good sound. I want to enjoy the whole experience of watching and listening. How about you?"
Neutral,"It's a good book, but the maps are not very good, covering only parts of central areas and there aren't subway maps. Moreover there isn't anything about hostels!"
Negative,"The narrative style of this work by famous founders' biographer John Morse is arrogant, flippant and frequently exaggerated. It carries the tone of the amateur Yankee historian on high, passing judgment on this Southern statesman who was neither from Boston nor a Harvard graduate. Perhaps considered penetrating for its day, it really represents nothing more than opinion today. The research is so thin that one must conclude that Morse wrote the entire manuscript essentially from memory, with little reference to the primary and secondary sources we expect of historians now. If it weren't for the fact that Morse wrote this piece 110 years ago, I'd have rated it only one star."
Very Negative,"This game requires quicktime 5.0 to work...if you have a better version of quicktime (I have 7.5), it will ask you to install the quicktime available on the CD...if you click no, it will not let you play. So, I begrudgingly clicked yes on the third try, and it installed quicktime 5, THEN it tells me to please install the quicktime available on the disc. It KEPT telling me that, even after I uninstalled my version of quicktime 7.5, and reinstalled Barbie Rapunzel and quicktime 5. Very frustrating, and the game absolutely will not work for me. It keeps telling me over and over, to install quicktime 5, tho I've been through the installation process repeatedly. It is NOT my ""operating system limitations"". This is a brand new computer...merely weeks old with all the state of the art contraptions."
Very Positive,"I purchased this software for my 5 year old granddaughter and she loves playing it so much. She lets me play it sometimes, but she doesn't always like what I come up with. I plan to purchase other software programs for her."
Very Positive,"My daughter absolutely loves this game! It's easy to use and requires no adult supervision. Best of all, it allows girls to use their creativity to design their own castle one room at a time. What more could a girl want! My daughter wants to play it every day and I have to find excuses to keep her away! Too bad not all the Barbie games are this easy and fun. I've been very disappointed in others I purchased. I discovered that they're not all designed/published by the same company. I paid 5.99 for this game on clearance and it's been worth 10 times this amount!"
Negative,"This game is pretty exciting and it is very nice and it is really creative and one of a kind. The only bad thing is that there is only one ""castle"" for the kids to ""decorate"" and once you are done with the whole castle that is basically it. You either have to create a new username for yourself to do it all over again or you get another game like I did. My sister finished the ""castle"" in about 2 hours and after that has never even looked at this game anymore. It is a nice game and it is fun but it is not really worth that much money."
Very Negative,"NEGATIVE: This game does not work with OS X and requires the CD so you can't have it on multiple computers. It is slow I have to tell my daughter that it is thinking a lot, this is because it has to access the CD everytime there is a new task. You can't view the openning sequence again without throwing out the saved game files. Some of the tasks and controls are too hard and not user friendly even for adults.it CRASHES all the time.Mouse is jumpy and hard to use.POSITIVE: Some tasks are easy, possible to use, grand and beautiful.My three year has enough patience to survive the multiple trials to get this to work."
Positive,My 4year old really likes this game. She's not addicted to it but loves the style of the program and it is one of her favourite games. I recommend this program for 4-7 year olds. Anybody older may find it limited.
Neutral,"I once purchased a 12"" of Jesse Rae's song RUSHA. I really enjoyed it and thought it might be nice to have an overview of his work. It's funny how you can remember somthing fondly only to hear it later in life and think...it's okay. Sorry, but the same is true for this recording, a bit dated, a bit tiresome, but fun."
Very Negative,This perfume is just AWFUL! Smells nothing like freesia.The gift recipient was not impressed. The worst is that it can't be returned!
Very Positive,"Written by Elizabeth Crary (a parent educator of 25 years' experience), Dealing With Disappointment: Helping Kids Cope When Things Don't Go Their Way offers parents, teachers, child care providers, and anyone else who works with children a straightforward guidance to teaching children how to meet and deal with seemingly insurmountable challenges. From learning to recognize when children are truly upset or shaken; to the dangers of trying to make or keep children happy at all times; to teaching young ones self-calming and problem-solving skills with step-by-step guides and games; to learning how to keep one's cool when the kids lose theirs, Dealing With Disappointment is an excellent and strongly recommended resource filled from cover to cover with positive and practical guidance and guidelines."
Very Positive,"Big Pokey is one of the best rappers out of the South. No one can do it like him. This album is a small example of what he can do on the mic. Need more proof, listen to the old Screw tapes. You must have this cd in your collection and be on the look out for that new Big Pokey coming soon!!!"
Very Positive,"This is an amazing blend of hot beats and a good rapper. It's underground, so many of you might be nervous about buying it. But, I'll tell you, Pokey sounds a lot like Biggie Smalls (BIG). He has biggie's style, usin words like sho nuff. Pokey's lyrics are good, but a few lyrics could use a little work. A few of his songs have complex beats, but most have a little bit of a more simple beat. The album comes together great. Get it! Trust me...its worth the money"
Very Negative,"These tracks are not the ""original"" versions but are re-recorded versions. So, whether the tracks are ""remastered"" or not is irrelevant."
Negative,"Tess Lindsay is content to be the sole occupant of a remote island but when Colin Macpherson washes ashore her life of solitude gets shaken up. Tess had always been told to fear strange men but she reluctantly strikes up a friendship with Colin. Soon Tess discovers that she has a family she had forgotten about but will she have the courage to leave the island and start a new life?The beginning of this book is very amusing and the end is decent too but the middle is a big problem. The plot loses much of it's believability mostly due to the poor characterization. All of the new characters that are introduced are one sided and their behavior lacks reason. Even Tess and Colin's development is side tracked in much the same way and their relationship seems awkward and forced. The writing does improve towards the end but it's not enough to save the book. Unless you have your heart set on reading all of the books in the series, skip this one."
Negative,"These pants were way too big (looked about 2 sizes larger), and they were incredibly stiff. They would have been very uncomfortable for my daughter to wear all day."
Very Positive,"THIS IS SIMPLY A GREAT ALBUM, FULLA CLASSIC BEATS AND SUPER FUTURISTIC INTELLIGENT BASS. ON OF MY FAVORITES."
Positive,"This is my first encounter with Yoruba and I have to say that CDs are really helping. However, the book is very short and not particular about certain aspects and details of grammar and other nuances - for someone who NEVER spoke Yoruba and doesn't have anybody to ask for a clue, it leaves a lot of questions unanswered - for this, however, there are hopefully other Yoruba textbooks.On the brighter note, I would like to add that the book does a very good job in giving a little insight on Yoruba people and Yoruba culture in general. I would recommend it as a good start book for anyone who wants to learn Yoruba - you can't go wrong with it."
Positive,works real good....a little hard to set up...web part doesnt work thru handset manager as advertised.....have to go into networking and turn it on
Neutral,It is a quality ball but the small is still too big and heavy for my little yorkie to play with comfortably.
Neutral,"I have to admit that this is a book I never would have thought to purchase given that it would mean reading the bio of an 18 year old kid!!! Still, it was a gift and I have to say that I was very surprised.The book is short (under 200 pgs) and is an easy read. However, I found that a lot of the book read like a magazine article, given that the author usually writes for Slam magazine, this is no surprise. Still, it is interesting and entertaining. I would recommend for fans of Lebron, high school ball, or die-hard hoops fans."
Very Positive,"Y TAMBIEN LA VIDA INTIMA DE LOS TRIUNFADORES...Por eso me fascinó este libro que me regaló mi esposa !Y seguro a mis cuantes tambien..porque alguno de ellos me ""incautó "" el libro !YA DEVUELVELO, BRO!"
Neutral,"Man I love Oh's cereal. It is really great to the last bite, but the size of the box its so small compared to all the other cereals out there. The price is crazy for such a small box...but oh's is one of the best cereals I have ever ever eaten. It keeps me coming back despite the small box, and crazy price. If you never had it you should try it just once. It is wonderful I give it 3 stars only because of the price and how much food you get. If the portions were more fair even for this price it would be five star gold..."
Very Positive,In a world where media is dominant this movie is so refreshing as it chronicles the agony of a person who yearns for God. Watch it! 0:)
Negative,"This book never really seems to get going. There is too much time spent in the courtroom while basic questions about the crime and the suspect/defendant are left unasked.After 200 pages, I realized that this book wasn't going to pick up or reveal any crucial information to make sense out of things until the very end.As a result, the whole story rapped up very quickly in an unbelievable way and you are left wondering why no one could figure anything out earlier. Based on the ending, the detectives and attorneys appear rather incompetent.I did enjoy parts of the book, however, and I think the plot needs to be unfolded at a different rate (not so slow in the beginning and not so fast at the end). I am a McBain fan and think that some of his other books are better written."
Positive,"This book is quite touching. It tells Dorie's story of all the unbelievably horribe things she experience while growing up being abused both physially and sexually. It gives hope to those who believe that no one's situation is as bad as their's or those who think recovery is not possible. If you are looking for self help to enhance you own healing journey this book is probably not what you need if you dont fall into the above categories. However, it is a great testimony to be aware of."
Negative,"While I believe in discrimination, I certainly can't believe what is in this book. It is an unsubstantiated smear campaign to rally the troups in higher ed to claw again for the preservation of academic freedom- a rally which falls flat."
Negative,"Sadly, there is absolutely nothing original in this movie. The filmmakers shamelessly borrowed from practically everyone, turning out a stale formula piece that is purely by the numbers. I couldn't find a thing that elevated this movie above a 100 other like films. The plot is standard: a group of kids spend the weekend at an old house with a bad history. A standard, run of the mill maniac kills them in unimaginative ways and of course no one notices until it's too late. Everything happens exactly on cue, in order, with no surprises, and no frights. This movie is safe and boring, it really couldn't have been any better if it tried. Not even the brief appearance of horror icon Michael Berryman (playing a nice guy for a change) can help the dullness of the script.Even the title is a misnomer! Although the original title, Maskerade, isn't any better.And I had such high hopes as this is one of my favorite genres."
Positive,"This book was in my library's Genealogy section, and you're not allowed to take Genealogy books out of the library. But I liked it enough to sit in the library and read it, in two sittings.This a quick read, because it has loads of pictures: photos of the ghetto and its inhabitants, and also pictures of artifacts such as ration cards, work certificates, yellow stars, etc. It's more like a museum exhibit than a simple book. Because of the format I think young people would be able to get something out of the book too, although it is clearly written for adults. Certainly it probably has the most information on the Kovno/Kaunas ghetto all in one place.Both researchers and the ordinary person interested in the Holocaust would enjoy this.Bonus: pages from the diary of Ilya Gerber are printed in this book; you can read extracts from the diary in Alexandra Zapruder'sSalvaged Pages: Young Writers' Diaries of the Holocaust."
Positive,"As a physician who is studying and doing acupuncture, I find this a good basic introduction to Traditional Chinese Medicine. It is heavily illustrated, which helps the reader to understand some very difficult concepts, which are alien to the Western mind, especially for medical personnel. I can highly recommend it for someone who is interested in becoming familiar with Acupuncture and other Traditional Chinese Medicine."
Very Positive,"I bought this pillow for my mother, fiancee and myself. My mother loves it and sleeps much more comfortably with it. My fiance will not sleep with out it; according to him it gives him the best sleep he's ever gotten. I hurt my back a while back at work and this pillow has helped my back pains go away while giving me a restful night. I would definitely recommend this pillow."
Negative,"I ordered this particular product as a trial substitute for the ""Controlgel"" by Textureline, which has always been my first choice. It appears that the ""Controlgel"" is out of production. This ""Smoothing Serum"" is a poor substitute. My barber agrees. He got me on the ""Controlgel"" years ago and I used to buy extra for him, but now, no more!! Too bad . . . we consumers lose again. I wish the ""Controlgel"" product would come back. My barber and I won't buy any more of the ""Smoothing Serum."" What a WASTE!!"
Positive,I've been using this model racket for around 15 years and it's still one of the best rackets ever made by Prince. The Prince Graphite Mid Plus is still one of the stiffest rackets you can get and it also has excellence weight and balance.This racket is more suited to the higher standard player. It provides exceptional control especially with volleys. I have these rackets strung at between 62-64 pounds for hard court and grass court play.It will be a sad day when there are no more of these rackets available.
Negative,"I didn't buy this game, becuase I can tell by the pictures that Barbie has very bad skating technique (see below). This game is not for kids who want to have fun while seeing a good skating program.Pictures on Amazon1) Box picture -- I can't tell whether or not Barbie is stroking or doing a bad spiral? Either her leg is too high if she is stroking, or her body and leg are not in the right position if she is doing a spiral.2) Layback -- Although it's hard to see, it looks like Barbie might be spinning on her toe pick.3) Split jump -- Barbie does not have enough skating muscle for the jump. She is also not kicking her boots up.Pictures on vugames (makers of the game)1) Stroking -- Barbie's body is crooked. She doesn't have her weight over her stroking leg, and her body is leaning to the side. I've never seen anyone stroke like this."
Neutral,This game interesting. It has good graphics and nice music. But if youre my age lets re-think the fun part. All you do is press up and down on the keybord and maybe you would hit the space bar. Well if your child likes challenging games well don't get this for them. THIS IS FOR A PRESCHOOLER!!!!
Very Negative,"Like many of the Barbie CD Roms, the playtime is limited - averaging about 5 mins for each of my two daughters (ages 5 & 7). Like the Barbie movies and other CD Roms the graphics are poorly done."
Positive,"I bought this game for my daughter who is almost seven. She enjoys it very much. It works perfectly with Windows XP. I like the fact that it has skill levels, which helps avoid the ""frustration factor"", which I'm sure most of you reading this have experienced. The only reason that I did not give it a ""5"" is because it is quick to complete, especially on the ""easy"" and ""medium"" levels. Unless your child is totally into figure skating or Barbie, I feel this game is not for the 8+ crowd."
Very Negative,"Very disappointed in this product. It worked perfectly for exactly three days and could not be resuscitated. It was very inexpensive so I did not want to pay half again the price to ship it back for an exchange, so the company would do nothing when they sent me an inquiry as to product satisfaction."
Neutral,"These work fine and we now have two in the apartment, but i often have to take the remote off the wall and bring it closer to the switch to get the lights to turn off. It's not the greatest product and to be honest the as seen on TV handy switch works much better and is much cheaper."
Very Positive,"I was sceptical about this book at first, I had never read L. J. Smith before, but my friend told me to read it and let me borrow her's. It was soo good. That was about a year ago. I have now read up to Black Dawn in the Night World series, and can't wait for more. I recomended these books to my other friends and they loved them too. I recomend ANY L. J. Smith books to anyone."
Very Positive,"I loved reading this book, it was so awesome. All of Lisa Jane Smith's books are. I was first drawn to this book because it involved three awesome sisters and they were all vampires. Plus I loved their older brother Ash! You have to read this book."
Very Positive,"I agree w/ the other fans: Chocolate is a fantastic single. If you like the song, you'll love the remixes! They give nice alternatives to an already gr8 song, and you'll get a bonus, non-album track. Highly recommended, and have a gr8 day, reader."
Neutral,I bought the DVD thinking it would be back to back episodes of Thomas with no interruptions. Instead it has footage of a Thomas event and children and adults giving reviews of Thomas and their favorite episodes. I found it cheesy and annoying. My son loves Thomas and I hoped it would be strictly the episodes and not other footage. Thankfully the footage between the episodes is brief enough to tolerate the video.
Very Positive,Our two-year old grandson loved this - and we enjoyed watching it with him. Some good lessons to be learned by any age!
Positive,My son really liked this as it shows some scenes from Thomas' Day Out which he could relate to having been before.The footage is mixed in with Thomas episodes and interviews. The brief interview sections did'nt really hold his attention but the rest is really good.
Very Positive,"What can I say it is a surge protector and small enough to use with small electronic items such as a wireless phone system, isolated devices and so on that do not need a big strip."
Negative,"I have bought dockers for years but these are cut smaller than they usually are. Even with the ""stretch"" waist band they are tight. So much for an ""extra"" inch. Beware. Try these in a store before you buy."
Negative,"I agree, these are cut small... Buy an inch or two larger than you normally do. The waist band does NOT stretch."
Neutral,"I ordered the individual fit Dockers pants. Although there was a tag on the pants that said they were individual fit, thy lacked the inside label I am used to seeing stating they were individual fit. The fit seems a little different from other individual fit pants I have purchased. I think next time I will go back to a local retailer."
Very Positive,This novel is just fun...not super serious literature but enjoyable.I would recommend this to anyone who loves Italy and food...You can read it in a day....
Positive,"This is a very fun book and if you love Rome, Romans, Romance and Food and Wine, you'll be ecstatic over this read! Enjoy and Bueno Appetito..."
Negative,"I bought this book to read as I myself ventured the streets of Italy...and to my dismay, the book was horrible. I searched everywhere for the book here in the states, and it was sold out everywhere...and to be honest, I am not sure why! All of the characters were not very well depicted, except for Laura. The description of Rome and the other cities the book took place in where not vivid. And the plot very predictible. The addition of the mafia in the story could have also been completely taken out...there was no need for it in the book! I just can't seem to think of anything really good to say about this book...maybe the recepies at the end are good to cook?"
Negative,"A clichéd storyline based on the classic Cyrano de Bergerac, this book reads like a rookie novel written by someone who has a knowledge and passion for Italian culture and cuisine, but little experience in developing a story. I can understand Bruno and his passion for cooking, but have no clue as to his passion for Laura. It seems to be primarily based on her being a blonde American. How exotic. Her character is so underdeveloped- we know she's studying art history, and she enjoys Bruno's cooking with a passion. That's about it. And Tomasso, he's just the cliché for any over-sexed Mediterranean male who encounters foreign females.It's a light and entertaining read if you can get beyond all of the reasons you should put it down and walk away. That being said, I will, however, check out this author's more recent novels. He does seem to have a way with technical details, hopefully his storytelling has caught up."
Negative,"This book as all about the joy of eating and cooking and love.It's a lot better when it deals with food than with love. In fact, food is not only a metaphor for love and love-making but seems a more than adequate substitute. People have virtual orgasms cooking and eating but the sex is pallid and occasionally positively unappetizing.I can see why this book has been successful but to appreciate it one has to overlook the thin characters and absurd plot, openly cribbed from Cyrano de Bergerac. The most enjoyable parts are the opening chapters. After that, the returns swiftly diminish.Still, for a plane ride, one could do worse I suppose."
Very Positive,"I feel ya ""Ghenry187@aol.com""...this CD rocks. No Limit can't touch Cash $ Money Records. I don't know why that new Tru CD sold one million in the first place. Who cares, 'cause I just checked the billboard charts and discovered that Juvenile sold more that two million. So they can't be faded. Anyway, back to this CD. Every song on this CD rocks. My favorite song is ""Help"" by B.G. I love this CD."
Neutral,"it really pains me to see bone thugs loose to the hot boyz for group of the year at the source awards.everybody was pi$$ed over that robbery.i have a lot of respect for southern rap music.but bone had a far superior album then this album.after that i lost all hope in the source awards.this album have a somewhat solid production value from mannie,but honestly the lyrics are kinda boring.and honestly is no where near as raw as older no-limit albums,and definatley far away from tripple 6 mafia albums."
Neutral,"Although better than there latest album I didn't care much for Guerilla Warfare. I found alot of the songs on the album to all sound almost exactly the same. It did have some outstanding hot tracks like I need a Hot Girl, Respect my Mind, and Tuesdays and Thursdays but most of the CD was just a bunch of decent tracks nothing that big. If you want to listen to good album by Cash Money get the Big Tymer$ Hood Rich album. That one is much better."
Neutral,Before i say anything about this album Cash Money Records is the Sh*t. I just didn't think this album was very good. The beats and hooks were not what i was expecting. I need a Hot Girl was the best song.
Positive,"This is a book that I read at home, in chunks of 30-45 minutes a night. I highly recommend this book, as both an introduction to HTML, and as a reference for beginner-to-intermediate programmers. It covers HTML in depth, but also mentions CGI, Cold Fusion, ASP, Javascript, and XML, and the role these technologies play in delivering a complete website. The book contains extensive information about Style Sheets, including an entire appendix devoted to the syntax and parameters for Style Sheets."
Positive,"and I have been quite satisfied.Although I don't think a ""Complete"" reference book on programming, especially HTML, can exist, this is as complete and updated as it gets.Being a professional and advanced programmer I might be tempted to claim this as the best book there is, but for beginners I suggest they start with a book which is more of a ""tutorial"" than a ""reference"". A smaller book that puts more emphasis on ""teaching"" the basic concepts than providing an extensive reference resource. But after that I strongly suggest they get this book.Remember, no single programming book can ever be a good reference while being a good tutorial. And we need both."
Neutral,"Being a great fan of ff6,I was impatient to listen to this record.At first I thought it was impressive with the orchestra.But then the more I listened to it the more I felt a bit disapointed.I think that some songs dont grasp the original feeling of the game and that some of them dont even respect the original tunes.But you mustnt get me wrong,it still stays a wonderful record,even though it is not totally faithful to the game. Anyway the best advice I can give is to LISTEN TO SOME SONGS BEFORE BUYING IT,to avoid any disapointment."
Positive,I have been using this product for years because I have a chronic cough. I think it helps keep my throat moist and helps prevent and alleviate sore throat.
Positive,A great guitarist with lots of feeling for his work. Can't wait for his next record!
Positive,love it...very touch.it's to bad that in the dvd description doesn't mention no subtitles
Negative,"the reason i gave two stars when I usually give 5 stars for ms. feehan's books is b/c this book was tooooooo mystery/gothic genre rather than romance. I really didn't feel like the two main characters were in love, in fact the entire book was almost entirely from the heroine's point of view and I was getting sick of her whining and her point of view. unlike the ""dark"" series, you really didnt feel any passion. the book is better suited for the mystery/gothic genre and NOT romance.even the mystery was not that good! its only in the last chapter that for some unforseen reason the villain confesses all in less than three pages. throughout the entire book, you're kept in suspense of who was the bad guy, if you wanted to know who it was look at the last couple of pages....Ms. Feehan, if your reading, please focuse more on the main characters relation to each other rather then distract us with so much unamusing mystery!"
Positive,"This is a very good background book for the Dark Series by Christine Feehan. Very romantic, sometimes a little slow, but still worth reading!!"
Very Positive,"This is another of Christine Feehan brilliant books. She can make you part of that, that is written. You start reading and you can't put it down, I know I couldn't. If you enjoy books of physical,telpathic and romance you will love this. Every time I read one of her books they just get better."
Positive,"This is truly an excellent camcorder for home movies and perhaps more advanced applications. I found myself toying around with the nightvision contantly. My only qualms about it was that recording videos to your PC is really dependent on how good a computer you have. For instance, my computer, which is fairly fast would typically have very smooth recording, but every once in a while would skip a few frames, and I would then have to go back and edit it. But don't get me wrong, I truly believe that this really is the best camcorder you can buy for this kind of money, and besides the computer transfer issure, I absolutely love the camera."
Positive,"Cornwell takes hold of your mind and does to let go until Scarpetta finds her solution. There is a horrible crime scene but it does produce some fingerprints. This is an easy case for Scarpetta until there is a match. It was a match to murderer that was executed before this murder. Read the book it is a good one. By Ruth Thompson author of ""The Bluegrass Dream"""
Positive,"This book was a bit more difficult to follow, in my opinion. I was lost toward the end. But Patrica is an awesome writer! I'm sure the problem was me, not her writing."
Negative,"I must say I was required to read this book for a class. If that had not been the case, I would have put the book down half way through it. I was put off by the excessive amounts of technical language and graphic descriptions of the state of murder victims. Quite frankly, I was very disappointed by this book."
Very Positive,I just wrote a review on this book and I forgot to include something. WHAT HAPPEND TO MARK. Out of the blue he's all of a sudden dead!
Positive,One of the best but all Scarpetta are terrific. Love how she continues the characters and creates wonderful story lines in each book. Scarpetta is a must read for crime mystery fans!
Positive,"This was my first Patricia Cornwell novel and I must say I was blown away. I never thought I'd warm up to a modern mystery writer the way I did with Agatha Christie and Dorothy L. Sayers, but Ms. Cornwell has displaced them both in my heart.C & E was by far the most fascinating book I've ever read. I sat up until the wee hours of the morning reading this wonderful novel, devouring every word, as I couldn't go to bed until I had finished it. The only disappointment was the ending. The killer came out of the blue, and there were too many loose ends.The story and characters were first rate and I intend to read all her other books. It's been a long time since I found an author I would be willing to pay hardcover prices to read."
Negative,"Although this might be a good book to introduce issues in technical writing to someone considering the field, it is not useful if you want anything more than a broad overview. The information it contains varies widely in depth and is sometimes dated; for example, there are several paragraphs discussing the features of dot-matrix printers but only one short and incomplete list of the types of bindings available for professionally printed documentation. For some unclear reason, two sections on editing are separated by 10 pages on usability testing. If you are actually involved in technical writing, there are better books."
Positive,"... and perhaps that's what made it unpalatable to many of his fans. Characters are extremely well-developed (AND portrayed), there is more heart underneath the expected ""potty humor..."" if Mr. Apatow continues to grow as a writer, I'll continue to watch his movies."
Neutral,"Length:: 6:20 MinsFunny People is really two movies -- One about Adam Sandler and Seth Rogen....and the other about trying to get back Leslie Mann and a whole bunch of extra drama. The story between the two guys is great, the other story takes away from the first.[...]"
Negative,"An acceptable movie, with some good moments by Adam Sandler, and some of the other new American comedy guys; but very far from his really ""funny people"" involved movies, like ""ANGER MANAGEMENT"" (with Jack Nicholson) or the hilarious ""LITTLE NICKY""."
Very Negative,"i cannot believe that an intelligent actor like adam sandler would degrade himself by acting in a degenerate , trailer trash movie like this,but i guess money makes some people do things that are beneath them. this movie is as funny as a sewer, all it is comprised of is endless and pointless profanity,virtually ever second word. the writer who has very little ,if not any intelligents, has substituted profanity for lack of intelligent writing.is the endless profanity suppose to make the male lead charactors appear more manly?. yes it is true that quentin tarantino movies has there fair share of profanity. however his movies use of profanity is justified as it is incorporated with intelligent writing. if you have very little or no intelligents or are a degenerate and trailer trash this movie will appeal to you."
Very Negative,my husband and I watched this and ended up watching something else. this will be a waste of your time
Neutral,Our book club tried the Rabbi's Cat to see what all the press concerning new grafic novels. I found it interesting but still prefer when reading a novel to have my own ideas of the people and surroundings. Guess that why after reading a novel I am not impressed with going to a movie with hollywood interruptations.
Very Negative,"The physics department at my school gets the mad ramblings of this man, and I usually end up with them (seeing as how no one else will read them). In a word, I sum these writings as ""nonsense."" Most of his ideas, aside from being mostly incoherant and physically absurd, also defy the time-tested and true concepts that the average high-school physics student could debunk. Furthermore, mixed in with these insane babblings, are religious and political ramblings, which he tries to pass off as the only possible truth.My recommendation, unless you want a good laugh or evidence of the under-education of many Americans, pass on this book. Any other use of your money would be a better one."
Neutral,"John Malatich: the man, the philosophy, the legend. Perhaps only two of the three will suffice to describe this author his magnum opus: ""The Theory of Everything is..."". Unintentionally bizaare, Mr. Malatich expresses his philosophy in swarms of capital letters and misplaced parentheses that invite the reader to vainly delve deeper into the text to find the hidden meanings that are simply not there. Unlike the Codex Sepentarius or the Voynich Manuscript, this work does not use its own script; however, like those two, the inscrutbility of text and alien drawings lend an otherworldly note to the text.Though I'm giving this book a 3/5, do not think that I'm endorsing Mr. Malatich's ideas, as I find them puerile and easily refutable by even the untrained eye. However, taken as a sort of 'art' , this book stands as a brazen testament to the American kook: those who willingly and unabashedly ignore reality in preference to living within its confines."
Very Negative,This kindly adaptation is a mishmash of gibberish. Amazon really needs to take more time in converting these. In this condition this should be free.
Negative,"Bought for my mom for Christmas she loves this perfume and it does actually smell pretty good however I was supposed to recieve my order by the 20th at the latest.its now the night of the 22nd and I am very worried it wont be here for Christmas. UPDATE: Spoke with Amazons customer service and they are replacing my missing item. It will be here tomorrow. Still sucks cuz it wasn't here in time for christmas, however I'm just glad they are replacing it for me."
Very Negative,"This supposed ""thriller"" is mind-numbingly dull and inept - I had to give up half way through."
Positive,"I read a lot of the reveiws, and I don't agree with quite a few of them. I thought this book was pretty good, and exciting. Yes, the plot is a little thinner than previous books, and yes Kay does wear on one after a time, but the forensics are awesome, and the suspense keeps on and on. I do have to admit that I do tire of Lucy somewhat. To me the books would be better without that added character. In this book Kay, Marino and Wesley are on the trail of the infamous Temple Gault (Kay's long time nemesis). The story is set around the week from Christmas Eve to New Year's Eve, but a lot happens in that short time. We see Kay, Marino and Wesley panicking as they try to nail down what seems to be the most notorious serial killer in the country at that time. Pretty good stuff!"
Very Positive,"This book by Patricia D. Cornwell holds the suspense and mystery as her other six Scarpetta novels, including the new one. It is wonderful because it offers what the reader is looking for if he/she has read other Cornwell novels. If that's what you like, this is what you're looking for"
Negative,"From Potters Field is one Patricia Cornwell's worst book she has written. It's not the characters, nope. It's not the writing that is wrong. It's the story that makes the book disappointing.Temple Gault has struck again. This time we know this for sure. Both the readers and Kay Scarpetta do. Someone from Lucy's past is also back. The problem with this book is that Gault is not a strong enough villain to carry this book. He is not scary or very threatening. It's not exiting. Partly because we never get into his head we are always inside Scarpetta's. Even if Cornwell did venture inside his head I'm not sure if it would be that exiting. For a killer on the loose plot its very weak, of coarse the forensics are very good and original. But for the most part a very disappointing Scarpetta novel."
Neutral,"Although I enjoy Patricia Cornwell's style andwould have loved to read another of her books,I cannot stand the ""better-than-thou"",militaristic,amoral, atheistic, adulterous lascivious feminismthat is being promoted in this book. My motherand sister are feminists and they go to churchevery week, care for their children and husbands,remain unconditionally faithful to their spouses,carry themselves gently, are very loving and, mostimportantly, desire equal rights with and notsuperiority over men."
Neutral,"Let me preface this review by saying I am a fan of Patricia Cornwell and her Scarpetta series. This book, however, is not up to the other books in this series and I was disappointed.This mystery features the same cast of characters as the other Scarpetta mysteries. However, the crazy sadist, Gault, appears to be a caricature of a person. There's one formulaic clue after another and it becomes unbelievable. The protagonist, Kay Scarpetta, is shop-worn and new characters are introduced but never developed. Marino, the politically incorrect, chain-smoking cop is the most real and endearing character in the book.Supposedly a mystery, this book drops clues from the sky, more in line with a fantasy."
Negative,"There sure is some exciting literature out there. This is not it. The material is very dry...desert comes to mind. I am using this book for my accounting 211 course at OSU, and boy is it fun (note the sarcasm). And what's with the dates in the example problems (such as 12/31/x1)? What is that? Were they too afraid to put a 9 in there? They didn't think we, the students, could handle it? But hey, I'm not bitter or anything. I don't even think you COULD make accounting interesting. A must read! (HA!)"
Very Positive,"In the tradition of Bastiat's - The Law, Haizlitt slays his philosophical opponents with clear, biting truth; and, packs it all into 100-odd pages. Especially appropriate given the time period in which it was penned, Haizlitt effectively puts to rest Keynesian notions of mathematical precision and makes the best case for economic freedom produced in the 20th century. Highly readable...a ""Human Action"" for the masses."
Neutral,"This book is most definitely an interesting read; however, I bought it with the purpose of helping me in a Microeconomics class. This book isn't about teaching you basic economics. It's more of an opinion piece. So buyer beware - if you're looking for an educational, informational, technical book about economics, this one won't fit the bill."
Negative,This book did not help me with my economics class. Even though I passed the course with a B. This book reads more like a novel and really does not simplify economics at all. I work better with definitions and examples and this book gives none.
Negative,"Although though we're (presumably) members of the same political choir, the author treats economics much too simplistically.Calling this book a polemic on Keynesian economics would be accurate, calling it an economics treatise would be just plain wrong.Time would be better spent reading Bastiat."
Very Negative,"This is one of the most disappointing purchases I have made on Amazon.The book is one long, myopic, libertarian apology."
Positive,"I think beyond the fact that Hazlitt produces a succinct and well-argued explanation for why free markets are the best arrangements in economic relationships, what is really wonderful is reading the screeds of those readers that he pisses off! Read the rabid ranting temper tantrum of the one reader who amazingly was accepted to the University of Chicago and you can see how ideas that actually support free thought and productive profitable endeavors drive lunatics like this crazy - its awesome!! This dork probably marches against the WTO."
Positive,I love the songs on this CD. Some of the songs make me want to run fast and punch stuff.
Negative,"I originally bought one of Daniel's previous albums (the title had 'insomniac' in it). the previous album was mostly acoustic with melodic vocals. I bought it for my wife. she loved it. Next year, I purchased deflaboxe and the CD got thrown back at me. This album was NOTHING like the previous album I had purchased for her. so if you are like me and buying this album based on his previous work, think again. he took a completely different style with this album."
Negative,"This children's book is a collection of nineteen folk tales collected and retold by the author from his travels throughout Central and South America. The book won the 1925 Newbery Medal for best contribution to American children's literature. I am oviously in the minority with my opinion: I only awarded the book two stars. I simply found it boring. But, this is obviously a good resource of South American folktales. Perhaps those who enjoy such material will like the book more than I."
Positive,"I have the nude version of this chincher in small.I favour a vintage pinup look every day so the small waist is a main focus. I do have vintage styled cinchers and other authentic shapewear but they are expensive. This is a perfect substitute for day to day wear.As said in annother review you cannot wear this under clingy slinky clothes as it does ripple up at the front.I would recomend wearing a slip under it to avoid skin irritation. I wear a corset liner available from waist training specialists.The length is fine on me, going from just below the bra line down to the hip bones (I am 5ft 4)The cinching effect takes about 1.5 - 2 inches off my waist comfortably, enough to get into my vintage dior.I do not wear it enough to comment on the claims of permenant inch loss...but I think I will give it a try."
Positive,"I am 5'6"", but I have a long torso. That resulted in a 2"" section of skin/fat that was squeezed out of the bottom of this thing. I ordered their vest to see if it would be a better fit for me. 4-stars though, because it did actually work, and appeared to have sturdy construction. It was a bit constricting at first, and it definitely felt good to take it off at the end of the night and breathe deeply--but it helped me look much better in a tight-fitting cocktail dress than I looked alone or with spanx!"
Neutral,"I ordered two different styles of the Squeem but the sizing is inconsistent. You may wear one size in one product and a total different size in the other even though it is fitting the same body part. Strange. Also, the edges of the product rubs against my skin and leaves bruises. I look like I got in a fight with a Tiger and lost."
Positive,"I was very skeptical about this. When I do wear it,it does work. It takes some getting used to."
Positive,"After 3 c sections, I need all the help I can get. I started with the size Large (when I was a size 12). I have moved on to the medium (I am between 8-10 now). The medium is REALLY tight, but does the job. I prefer the large day to day because I have 3 children under 6 to run after, and it is a bit more comfortable for that. These things are really great. I can't believe I didn't know about them after my first 2 c sections. They should send all women home with them after giving birth!"
Positive,Took off a few inches of my waist and kept it there! A bit tough to get used to so I recommend using a tank top under the squeem.
Neutral,"I've been wearing my squeem off/on for about 2-3 weeks. I haven't noticed a change in my waist size but when I have it on, I look really good. It gives me that nice curve that I usually don't have. I've not given up hope on it yet."
Negative,"The package says it goes from lower belly to just under bust. I am a short woman and it doesn't reach my ribs leaving me with two huge rolls of fat on the front and back. It takes me in great, love that about it but because it isn't long enough I can't wear it anywhere:("
Neutral,"I purchased this product for postpartum compression, and I only found it to be okay. The sizing puzzled me as I seemed to fit into 3 different sizes - XS for dress size, M for actual measurement, and S is right there in the middle. I ended up with the medium which fits but I think I should have purchased the small. I also purchased the belly bandit, and for postpartum compression I would much prefer that product. I do agree that the squeem makes for a good shape and it is comfortable to wear."
Negative,"I went by the Squeem chart and my waist measurements to find the correct size but to my suprise the waist cincher did not fit. Warning, you cannot return for a refund; only merchandise credit/exchange. Also, the cincher smelled like burnt rubber. Very bulky and will be visible through clothing so you cannot wear with tight fitting clothing."
Negative,"I bought this to slim down my tummy under a bridesmaid dress. First, it smelled horrific and still stunk like rubber after washing. Second, it did almost nothing to slim me down, even though I bought the suggested size. Third, after about a half hour of wearing it, it was absorbing sweat and making me feel clammy and uncomfortable. It was extremely uncomfortable to sit down in, and the boning showed through the relatively thick cotton of the dress. I abandoned it completely and felt much better."
Negative,"This product sucks!It doesn't completely suck... the 2 days I was able to wear it before the boning snapped in half it did compress pretty tight. As many people have noted, it is HELL to get into this the first time.I liked that this wasn't a body suit and the rubber on the outside would keep my shirt from sliding up.BUTThis garment:1) Rides up- if you move a lot it will eventually slide up your waist2) Leaves a huge crease on the skin above your waist-- and it hurts3) Makes you look like a sausage when you sit down: visually divides your belly in half when you sitAs I said I only wore this twice, first time I wore it for about half hour and the second time I had worn it for several hours when the boning snapped in half and was poking into my side (ouch!! )RETURNING THIS!!!"
Negative,"When I ordered this I thought it would allow me to wear some clothes that I haven't been able to do in a while because of my weight gain.I am a woman who has size 40D in breasts so I wear a large in tops and I wear a size 8 in pants, and weight 140lbs. It is suppose to clinch your waist and give you a nice looking figure. Well, it did hug my waist, but it also gave my a muffin top. Not a shape a woman wants to have. I looked better without wearing it. It folds into your folds creating a bigger fold at the top of your body. I would say this item is more for the extremely skinny female who has small breasts', no hips, or ass. Not for a woman who has large breast, hips, and ass. Not for women who are going through post-pregnancy either. For a product thats is suppose to make you feel good about yourself, it failed."
Neutral,"This product is OK. The ideal behind it is great, but in my case it needs to be longer I think. I'm not tall about 5'6"" & weight about 155. After I get it on there is a roll between the bottom of my bra and the top of the waist cincher. It would be alright if your shirt isn't very snug, but isn't that the whole purpose of the waist cincher, to be able to wear jeans, shirts & dresses that are a little close fitting. It does help with the hang over with the lower cut jeans. Its just hard to wear a tight fitting shirt with them. Other than that it works pretty good. Would like to try the squeem vest to eliminate the roll between bra & waist cincher."
Positive,"I like this product. I suffer from chronic love handles especially when I wear jeans. I am 5'1"" and 122 pounds. I bought a medium because I tried my friend's small and it was way too tight for me. The medium fits well. It does get a bit hot. I love the way it hides my love handles."
Very Negative,"The squeem is a great idea but the construction is not the best. While the product compresses your stomach, the inner metal spines bend and then protrude at the ends. I have had to sew the ends repeatedly but the spines keep poking through. At one point, the spine developed some sort of crack and when it poked through the bottom, it scraped my stomach and I took it off immediately. I have never washed the product in the washing machine...I have always handwashed it. So, the manufacturer can't say that I didn't take good care of it."
Positive,"I only just started wearing this today but already I know I'm going to be wearing it daily, and without discomfort. I'm 6 weeks postpartum and really needed something to help me shrink back down to my former size and I do believe this WILL do the trick.So far, the hype is true. It doesn't roll down on the edges and it really evens out the figure very nicely - even under clothes you can't tell you are wearing this. I guess a con would be that I can see how you'd get sweaty wearing this all day long and especially in hot weather.Overall, I am impressed so far."
Positive,This item is very sturdy and holds in the belly area better than another softer belt I have. The measurements seem true to size and there are two rows of hooks so you can adjust if you lose some weight.The only negative points are that the item smells badly of rubber when new. It must be washed before wearing. The other is that all that rubber can make you sweat. But those are minor complaints if you want to look good for an evening. The belt also helps me sit straight so I think it's good for the back as well as the front.
Very Positive,I bought this product because it promised to help improve bad posture and it does. Even when I am not wearing it I find myself sitting more erect than I used to. I love it!
Very Negative,"the first day,( 8 hours wearing it ) it hurt me so bad , my skin was torned, itched, swell, deep red. I tried to wear other side, after few hours, I got deep burned both on the right and left belly, the skin was torned, swell, bleeding, lot of cross cut on the skin, itched for a week until now. It looked like I was beaten up or have skin disease...I am scared to dead when I look at it now. I don't know why I got it , I used something like this before, but I didn't get any bad thing. or the rubber hurt me ?"
Negative,My wife loves it but we unfortunately perchaced the wrong size. She made a coment about the sizing chart being in dress sizes and she picked the size she is and we received it and the apparel was way too small. We have been meaning to exchange it but its tough to get time being as we have new born twins. That's why she wanted the apparel. She was really excited to receive the part and was disappointed when it didn't fit.
Neutral,"I went back and forth over whether or not I should purchase a small or a medium. My waist measured at 30"" just right there on the cusp. I ended up ordering the small and had the hardest time getting the booger on! And oh man UNCOMFORTABLE! Yes, it cinched my waist, but the areas that weren't inside the squeem bulged out grossly e.g. above the squeem, had a nice fat roll below my bra, not attractive and could not be hidden. I looked like a nightmare in clothes. I also didn't like that it didn't cinch my hips, meaning my pants didn't fit any better. It did make my waist tiny and gave me an hourglass figure, which I have never had before. In the long run it's getting returned. It just didn't give me the silhouette I wanted, and I don't think any amount of wearing it is going to do that."
Negative,"This product was not what I expected so I returned it. Too tight, sizing was misleading. I'll stick with my Spanx."
Neutral,"This is a very heavy cotton, almost too thick. It is strpped blue just like the picture. I was thinking the picure was just another style and the one ordered would be poka dots since that is the title. I have a little girl so the blue stipes don't go. You are ordering the exact picture above so no dots!!"
Neutral,The picture looks like a burnt warm orange but these are Bright orange. I really don't like the color but too much trouble to return.
Neutral,wish the product description had included where it was made. it was made in china. it is a well made product.
Very Negative,This movie was horrible. It did not play right when I was watching it online. I liked how it went by old vampire styles. Such as crosses worked and you had to invite them in and such. But the ending was really bad. Do not waste your money on this one. Also the storyline did not really make much sense.
Positive,"This is a good puzzle-but you have to put the pieces in correctly or they don't fit well. I work with kids who have autism and this frustrates them sometimes. Otherwise, it is very durable and I use it a lot."
Very Positive,"Rhapsody in blue is a cool song, i guess. i'm listening to the song right now for the first time. it's cool. ,e sp driml"
Neutral,"Edge of Danger is a step above a number of recent Jack Higgins tales. The protaginist - Sean Dillon, must track down a dangerous Middle Eastern billionaire before he can reek havoc on the world. While prior to 11 September, this book is relevant to our crisis. Higgins does a nice job bringing out more dimensions of Dillon and some of the other good guys. The author bumbles a chance to knock off a key character - losing the opportunity to add some tension and passion to the survivors. Incredibly, this person takes three bullets and lives. The plot is solid and fast paced. My only problem is with the enemies. They are too cold and their motives are weak. The key assaisin could audition for the Key Stone Cops. Don't get me wrong, the Edge of Danger is a good yarn. I hope Higgins continues to improve the depth and reality of his characters. I look forward to the next edition."
Very Negative,"This is my very first book review. Because this book is so fundamentally wrong I need to speak up. The main character Sean Dillion, formal IRA, has a license to kill and make the killing like a game rather than justice. He does whatever he wants to do without follow orders nor has any boundary. He pickup a couple of his terrorism/criminal partners making killing like a habits, terrorism competition, fun game and egoism fulfillment. It so far from any common sense such as the British General could not control this maniacal killer and let he kills who he wish to kill or threaten his masculinity. The killings like a joke to him and have absolutely no legal consequence. This book has promote violence behavior has no artist nor entertainment value. I lost my interest in Jack Higgins Sean Dillion's serial after finishing this ridicules book."
Very Negative,I was a big fan of Jack Higgins adventures until this book! I think this book reads like a poorly written condensed version of a good story - or like the outline of a book. It jumped around too abruptly with poorly written dialogue - no conversation was stretched into a normal length of exchange between people. It was difficult to keep track of all the minor characters in the book because none of them were well developed. I will proabably never read another Jack Higgins book. I am very disappointed - just like I got with Robert Ludlum in one of his later novels. I have never read another book of his either.
Neutral,"Look. I can't really disagree with the other reviews. However, I enjoyed this book. If you, as have I, read every Sean Dillon book in the series you will enjoy spending a few hours with these characters who have become so familiar after so many years. Great literature? Not a chance. A good read for fans of Jack Higgins? Definitely!!!!"
Positive,It's got a nice warm scent of vanilla-like smell. Texture is creamy. Meadow Sweet is a nice nude color. Can't apply too much or else it'll look a bit dry.
Negative,Only has limited access to OBDII data stream unless you pay more money to upgrade the software.
Negative,Written in old English. It was very hard to read as I had to think through most sentences to figure out what was being said.
Neutral,Thought I was getting a book received book on tape. a little deceiving. Rather than that the process went as expected. If it had been what we wanted would have been great.
Negative,this book was recommend 2 me from my neighbor. but i dont think that dis is dat gud of a book 2 recommend... i didnt like it 2 much but...
Positive,"I believe that this is a fantastic book for those who have more distinguished tastes. As for others, it is a slow read with challenging vocabulary."
Positive,I always liked this book. The kindle version is kind of difficult to navigate but it does its purpose. I can still go back to my last read without any problem.
Very Positive,"Hawthorne wrote a masterful work of historical fiction incorporating an examination of guilt, revenge and suffering in the context of Puritan Salem. Here is a book that speaks to any age about timeless themes. The Scarlet Letter is one of those books that may have force fed to one during grade school but revisited from the perspective of adulthood it is a very fine example of great writing from a true American master."
Positive,"I was quite pleased with the condition of this book, as well as it's hardcover, and the footnotes, definitions, and reading reviews for beginner readers of the genre. I am, of course, a huge fan of the Scarlet Letter itself and this copy served its purpose well. One of the few disappointments was that the color of the cover seems to look a little more coral, or pink, than scarlet or red. Also, the back cover is white, and I am most definitely one for appearances. I would have like a slightly more classic looking cover. Nonetheless, the binding will look fair on my bookshelf. Over all the book was clean and well taken care of, and was shipped to me with great haste; A Good Buy."
Neutral,I know this is a classic but I just could not get into the story. Thought I would try electronic books but I need the paper feel when reading.
Neutral,"I did not read much of this book, however, I do remember some of it. Often when I discuss comparative literature, I tend to use the example of Charlse Dickens's ""A Tale of Two Cities"", for in Dickens's famous novel, there are about five hundred pages of mere background information. And so, we have the style of Nathaniel Hawthorne presented to us: he is, in essence, a lover of symbolism and all things literarily analyzed. I really got into the story when the first pyre scene happened... Now, note, when I said pyre I meant pillar, for pyres are something entirely different and generally greek/medieval... Anyway, as I was saying, Hawthorned loves literary symbolism and creativity. I love the way he ended the plot, but I think that the story line could have moved a little faster, thus giving ""The Scarlet Letter"" a Dickens-like quality."
Negative,"I had to read The Scarlett Letter for my honors english 3 class. I found that the author was too verbose in describing people, places, situations, and just the story in general. The book was so wordy, I often found myself forgetting the topic of that particular paragraph. Also, I was disturbed to find out that ever day the Reverand A. Dimmesdale would beat himself, and stay up till the early morning hours!"
Very Negative,"I read this ""Classic"" novel for a class, and must admit I was thoroughly disappointed. Hawthorne should have stuck to writing non-fictional books about the Puritan settlers. This book was a pill. There are so many American authors, and novels that could be taught in schools that could far exceed the entertainment level of this out of date story. Two thumbs down."
Positive,"I am not one who enjoys romance, however Hawthorne's Scarlet Letter is truely an unshakable landmark in American Literature. Unlike most people, I read this novel in college (I don't know why junior high teaches this book; it's way to advanced for that intensity of reading) and depicted it as a soap opera in Puritan society. The novel inhibits sex, suspense, drama, and romance all in one pakage. I found the invidious Roger Chillingwoth to be an extremely interesting aspect about the novel's well-rounded plot. The theme of the novel is sin, and how tragically easy it could destroy a normal town denizen. I mean, all 3 main characters are virtually consumed and eventually destroyed by their own private sins. Read this book; by doing so, one will appreciate truly powerful literature that still shakes our foundation today."
Positive,i liked good book from the past....great that we can look back on these great books and enjoy them .
Positive,"Scarlet Letter is a kind of book that you understand it and you love it or you dont understand it and hate it. I think this deserves four stars because of the idea of the book. A stand for adultry in this book and tells the story of puritans in that time period. Hester and Pearl faces lots of insult in this community and if you want to find out whot the secret father of Pearl is READ the BOOK!!! But I would recommend to read this book after you are 14 years, because the Idea of the book is too matured."
Negative,"This book is one of the last masterpieces written as American literature moved from what we call ""Old English"" (use the much cliched Olde if you must) to ""New English."" And trust me, it shows. Virtually every book ever written during this period, (essentially, before Twain's Huckleberry Finn), bears the same markings - incredibly lavish diction, complex structure and syntax, and all the elements that make for a generally hard to follow novel. If you elevate your reading to that next level, where you're seeing beyond the simple plot and percieving Hawthorne's masterful use of symbolism and metaphor, and are able to appreciate probably the last great novel written in before the literary revival of the late 1800s, then you'll consider this book a worthwhile read."
Very Negative,"This book has to be one of the most tedious works of literature ever written. Hawthorne is a great writer, but I don't know how this book made it into that sacred list we call ""classics"". Perhaps on the merit of his name alone?"
Positive,"The Scarlet Letter shows Nathaniel Hawthorne at his finest. The imagery is quite wonderful, but there's only so many times you can say the same thing. The images in this novel stretch out far longer than needed.I nearly couldn't make it through. I do like to see every detail given it's fullest attention but even this is too much.This book is one that is very vivid and quite pleasing to understand, but hard to read and not as easy to follow. Sometimes there's only one resourceful fact in a half a page paragraph.Recommended."
Neutral,Thie book isnt terrible I had to read it for my AP English class and so far it has been the easiest read. I would recommend it to anyone who likes books of that time frame.. The language uses a lot of thee's and thou's
Very Negative,i couldn't listen to this book because the women reading it has such a screechy horrible voice so i can give no review of the actual book but whatever you do try to find a version with a different reader if you're into audio books
Neutral,"I've always wanted to read this and when I got the chance, I was a bit disappointed. The language was difficult for me to grasp and there were few scenes that I understood what was going on. After reading this, I don't understand why it is a classic. Although the message of the book was clear, the Shakespeareian-style writing was hard for me to understand."
Neutral,"I finally got around to reading this classic work last year and was quite disappointed. I tend to limit my reading these days to two primary realms, classic literature and early 20th Century fiction, and this one just didn't measure up to the standard set by other famous authors of Hawthorne's day.It's a simple story about scandal and I guess I was expecting so much more. I wish I could say it was superbly-written but I think that it reflects a lack of committed effort on Hawthorne's part."
Neutral,"I liked this book as I was reading it. It was really interesting to see Puritan life through Hester Prynne's eyes. I think one reason that I liked it has to do with the fact that I skipped reading the first part, ""The Custom House."" I didn't read it when the teacher told the class to read it, and I wrote a paper on it and got an A.All in all, a good book, but I don't think I would've gotten through more than half of it if I hadn't been pushed into it by my English class. Looking back, though, I'm glad I read it because a lot of other works have some thing(s) in common with ""The Scarlet Letter,"" and it would be a shame to graduate with a degree in English without reading it."
Very Negative,"I will never understand why they force this book on school children, I'm sure there are many other ""classic"" stories that could be included in the curriculum."
Positive,Well I read this book and it amazed me. The first time I read this book I thought it was stupid. page after page it got better. Well this book is about a girl who commits an adultery. The girl's name is Hester. So she gets an A on her dress and she goes to prison. Her husband left her like a coward. and I don't want to ruin the story so I will recomend this book to anyone who wants a good read. When I read this book i thought it was hard comepare to the books LORD OF THE FILES and THE ANIMAL FARM. so just read THE SCARLET LETTER.
Neutral,"Hawthorne has written a book deeply in psychological symbolism and wordy sentences. This book is for those with enough patience to let a deluded, complex story develop -- not a story for me, even though I have read many in the genre."
Positive,"The best book that I have ever been assigned to read for school by far. The way in which Hawthorne captures the shame that Hetser , the wearer of the scarlet letter, feels everyday and the utter torment that the weak Dimmesdale is in by not coming forth and saying he slept with Hester and the revenge ridden character of Chillingworth is spectactular.The way in which Hawthorne describes the setting and the actions that characters do is truly outstanding. Hawthorne has a huge flare for the dramatic which is great for the reader. Since Hester the main character concieved her daughter Pearl through an affair she has been snetenced to wear the scarlet A on her chest for the rest of her life. The story starts on the day Hester is to stand infront of the town and wear her badge of shame and all the drama in the small puritanical town of Boston starts from there. A must read for any American."
Neutral,"I, as a 10th grade student, had to read The Scarlet Letter for school. at first, what came to mind was ""this is going to be the most boring, hard to read book ever, as most school books are."" I started reading it and my nightmares were coming true. i didn't understand half of what Hawthorne was trying to say. this really put me down but once we started discussing the chapters that we had read, i realized what it was about and how good it actually is. Once i knew more about the story, reading became much easier. (some parts, though were just plain tedious.) the imagry that was used was amazing and the plot was excelent. i would have given more stars but some of it was just too complicated and i couldn't follow it.Bottom line: everyone should read this book because it is a classic for a reason. (it really is a good book) but you might want to get a guide to it or maybe cliffnotes so it is esier to understand."
Very Negative,"No, I'm not talking about Hester's crime. I'm talking about this STUPID BOOK! If only Hawthorne had kept his job in the customs house (see prologue), this abomination would never have been spawned from the cess-ridden depths of Hawthorne's twisted thinking organ. (You can figure THAT out on your own). This book is untolerably boring (the only proven cure of insomnia - if you don't mind the side effects) and the descriptions are ridiculously entangling. In the words of Mr. Hawthorne himself, this book is ""ignominiously"" dull. PRESERVE YOUR SANITY! NEVER READ THIS! NEVER!I sleep now..."
Negative,"If you can read and readily understand old-english, you *may* be able to enjoy this novel.I found it painfully long and didn't even care to finish it, which is unheard of for me!"
Negative,"It shocks me that the Scarlet Letter is the most taught book in the nation. It may have much symbolism and so on, but it is a convoluted mess. The author is completely detached from his audience, and for some bizarre reason, he feels he has to explain every little thing that happens in great detail. It is also irrelevant to our modern times. In our days people need to be reading things like Huxley, Orwell, Fitzgerald, Bradbury, Hemmingway, Steinbeck, Salinger, and many other great 20th century writers. This book is only relevant to those interested in the time period which it discusses."
Positive,"Quick read because the book is really a short story and some of the character language can be annoying but necessary per the theme of the novel . Interesting read especially since the book was written in the late 1800s but set in our future. Not your typical ""end of the world"" novel with all the ""glitter"" and multiple story lines like Earth Abides (same genre) but for being written so long ago the author hit the nail on the head per the cascading long-term effects of a ""Scarlet"" event."
Very Positive,a classic book where there is really nothing bad to say about. AS an adult though one can appreciate it more because we choose to read the book instead of it being an assignment that needs to be completed for school.
Neutral,"I had to read this book, which I had heard quite a bit about, for school but after reading it I had no idea why it is considered such a classic. There is no question that the language is old-fashioned and difficult, but that isn't the only problem I found with it. The whole story was rather boring. It seemed that the author tried to make a lightweight story about an affair and the child that was a product of it deeper or more important by describing how the characters felt. The book was not exactly bad, but, like many other books, it does not really deserve its status as a classic. I saw it more as a book that showed somewhat the morals and ideas of the Puritans. While it is good in that sense, I don't think that it is very important in modern times, and it certainly wasn't a fun read."
Neutral,"This book was purchased for my daughter for a class. I remember reading it in high school and yeap, still almost as drawn out as it was back then. We both think the same thing. But, a good read nonetheless."
Very Negative,"A classic? Hardly. In it's time this book may have ruffled feathers but these days it's a struggle to get through. Hawthorne's writing style is dreary and dreadful; if captivating readers was his aim, he failed miserably."
Positive,"The whole time reading The Scarlet Letter I thought that it was just extremely interesting. The characters were well-developed and at times, endearing. The way that Hawthorne is able to describe the torture that Reverend Dimmesdale undergoes is very believable. Although I am only thirteen years old and have never committed adultery, I find it easy to relate to Hester Prynne. And Pearl, my most favorite of all the characters, just adds a very interesting touch to the story. Despite the good characters, I did not like the fact that during most of the book, parts of the main plot are dismissed for chapters at a time to describe something not always commpletely relevent to the story. But, overall, I thought this book was very interesting, and would definately take the time to read it."
Very Negative,"I used to live in Hawaii. Plumerias were abundant, both growing and leis. I was excited to have that scent again in a lotion. The lotion itself is your average body lotion consistency. However, there is NO way that this is a true plumeria scent. I would not order their other ""Plumeria"" products (which are more expensive)based on this lotion."
Positive,"This is IMHO the best of the 4 Killer Tomato flicks. We even get to see Gary Condit briefly (from the back) in the pizza parlor fight scene!Without spoiling the surprises, I'll just say that the movie features a very sexy tomato who was once a real tomato."
Very Positive,"Return of the Killer Tomatoes is hilarious. Anthony Starke is great. J. Stephen ""Rock"" Peace is back as Lt. Wilbur Finletter. This is the best movie in the Killer Tomato Triolgy."
Very Negative,"As good as this book may be, the print quality is so bad that I cannot read it. Zero stars would have been more appropriate."
Neutral,"All of the screws need to be double-nutted to keep them from backing out due to vibration. Replacement lamps are difficult to find, my husband ended up using 12v marker lamps from an auto parts store. Eats sidewalls for breakfast on skinny-tired bikes. A piece of 3/4"" air hose slipped over the wheel makes it able to run on the rim instead.The rear light is made to mount to a fender, FYI."
Very Positive,IF YOU NEED A GOOD LAUGH THIS IS THE ONE. I DON'T LIKE ANIMATED MOVIES BUT THIS IS SOOOOOOO FUNNY. THE CHARACTERS AND HUMOR CAN'T MAKE YOU FEEL SAD AT ALL. A GOOD FLICK AFTER A TOUGH DAY AT THE OFFICE.
Neutral,"Just cuz it's a cartoon, and about the holiday's, does not make it a family movie. The movie was everything I expected, no real surprises. That said I do not feel the adult content shuold be used to grade the movie. My kids will not be seeing this for some time. My copy has PG-13 PARENTS STRONGLY CAUTIONED clearly stated on the back."
Negative,"The early success of Adam Sandler's films gave him this mistaken impression that he was an actor and a writer. This film proves he is neither - and a grating voice-over guy to boot. I enjoyed Happy Gilmore and to a much lesser degree, Little Nicky and Big Daddy. But Sandler is a one-trick pony. We've all seen the trick, so it's just not interesting anymore. I thought this might be the one Hanukah film in a world of X-mas fare. It has nothing to do with the holiday and is definitely not for kids."
Neutral,"I went to my sisters boyfriends house, and his roomate bought a couple of DVDs and this was one of them. I saw it, it wasnt boring, but it was stupid and it was funny, I expected more from this film, but its worht watching if like comedy and Adam Sandler."
Very Negative,Eight Crazy Nights is the thrid back to back unfunny movie(following Little Nicky and Mr Deeds) that Adam Sandler has made in the past two years. Eight Crazy Nights is full of toiler humor and unfunny one-liners. I may have laughed once or twice if these movie. They should have called Eight Crazy Ways to ruin a comic's carrer.
Positive,"Adam Sandler is one of our favourite actors,and this is such a funny movie for all ages why would you not want it in your collection.Some may think its a bit much for children under 5,But my children 9+ loved to see Christmas cheers and a drunken fool wake up to the real world and how not everybodys life is bliss.It was a great movie to laugh, watch and learn all in one."
Very Negative,"8 Crazy Nights might have been a sweet film with a good message for kids, but the scatological humor, offensive language and explicit sexual references made it unsuitable for my 10-year old. The plot, on the other hand, while fine for 10-year olds was too obvious and simplistic for most of the adults in the audience. As a result, while it's probably not the worst film of the year, it is certainly in the running."
Very Negative,"In two of the episodes, the word ""shut up"" is used. My son is three years old and instantly picked up on it, repeated it, and told me it was a bad word, but that James and Duck (the trains) had said it. I would stay away from this one, especially if you have young, impressionable youngsters. I gave it one star, since the wooden dragon train came with it."
Very Negative,"""Spinout"" (1966) represents the nadir of Elvis Cinema - a bad sitcom without the laugh track. The only redeeming features are a few memorable songs, such as ""I'll Be Back"" and ""Stop, Look and Listen."" Buy the soundtrack and skip the movie."
Negative,"This is not Presley's best vehicle but by this outing he was not being allowed to act anyway so he appears to be just going though the motions. The movie songs are not a real treat either, he seems to be singing to everyone including his enemies. (Where does the music come from when he sings anyway). When asked to do this movie Presley should have ""JUST SAID NO""!!!"
Very Positive,"I love this desk! In fact, I have two! One for my daughter and one for my son. They are beautiful, flawless and go together easily. They are sturdy and should last a many years. So happy with this purchase!"
Very Negative,This one makes too small and too fine a grind of pepper to be useful in cooking. You'll be cranking away on this thing for ten minutes before you get enough crushed pepper to flavor anything.
Positive,"I am satisfied with this product. I can stick it to the fridge (it's magnetic) and have it readily available while I'm cooking. The plastic looks a little flimsy, but I think it's good value for the money."
Negative,"I have only read the first 44 pages of this book, so I'd need to read the rest. So far, though, it is interesting but seems fuzzy. The writer makes a lot of claims but I was rarely sure if they were proven or just speculation. This is the kind of sentence that makes me queasy:""Given all the activations happening at once [in the brain], physical performance probably uses 100 precent of the brain"" (p. 39).Probably? Why? Does any one activity use 100 percent of the brain? And if physical performance does, why is that important?"
Neutral,I have heard Jensen speak at workshops and wanted to follow up his presentation by reading one of the books he mentioned.
Positive,"I purchased this book to refresh my professional development. The ""latest trend"" these days in education seems to be shifting to BBL (brain-based learning), so I wanted to update myself.I flipped through it first and saw that there is a lot of diagrams, figures, the text is easy to read, and understand.I haven't read through the entire book, but so far I can tell that this will be a useful reference or resource."
Neutral,"They refunded the book without notifying me of this, so I was left book-less by the beginning of the term. :("
Very Positive,This is a very nice lunchbox with beautiful colors and images. It is made of durable and washable material. And one great thing about it is that it is different as it does not have any common TV character on it.
Neutral,"I fell in love with El Cielo, which was in fact my first forray into the musical world of Dredg. El Cielo is an amazing album that follows a concept of sleep paralysis. Then I found Leitmotif, which neither moved me nor gets much spins in my cd player. Then I found Catch Without arms, which nether dazzled me nor wowed me at all. There are a few good tracks, but other than that, this album follows standard rock formula. I understand that die hard fans of Dredg will eat this album up and beg for more, but what really drew me to El Cielo was the concept album aspect and the off beat musicianship, both of which are missing from Catch without arms. Though standard, Catch without arms is decent, not a must have, but decent."
Very Positive,"Right now dredg is my favorite band. I absolutely think Catch Without Arms is one of the best albums of all time, I can listen to this over and over and have been. I like this album better than El Cielo. I can 1-repeat Zebraskin all day, that song can transport you out of a funk any day!"
Neutral,"While this album certainly isn't the same music Heart was known for in the 70s, it brought them back into the music spotlight and brought new fans. Some people who like to act self important wanna call this type of change ""selling out"", but look at all the other bands of the past who refused to change - most of them are nowhere and forgotten. Very few bands of that era have a sound that maintains through time. Put ""bands of the 70s"" in your search browser and see what comes up. There's maybe 5 bands on that list that continued to produce music successfully thru the 80s and 90s. And Heart is one of them. When it comes to entertainment, if you wanna survive, you gotta give the fans what they want. And that's what Heart did on this disc and a few more after this."
Very Positive,"This is one of the greatest swing albums of all time. I'm not exactly sure who played what parts (someone said that the channel credits were reversed), but Ellis and Robillard both sound great. They seem to have a bottomless well of creative and melodic swing phrases that they can throw around at will. This album will put you in a good mood quick. Make sure to check out the sequel album too - it's just as good."
Very Positive,"The entire Charlie Brown series are wonderful, just purchased this one for my grandson. Would recommend as gifts for friends and family."
Very Positive,It was a gift for my dad and he loved it. One of his favorite holiday movies. Which he always seems to miss each year. Now he will have it always.
Neutral,"The original Christmas special is good, but you're mostly paying for another ninety minutes of subpar stuff. Flashbeagle is an abomination. I would have paid half for a quarter of the cartoons in here.If you can get the DVD instead of the Amazon Video version cheaper, do it."
Very Positive,This is a timeless Christmas classic that still brings a lump to your throat. The music from this special is wonderful as well. A classic!
Very Negative,"Every year I think we get going too quickly and make an impulse buy that's foolish. This was our purchase this year. Thankfully we got a 50% credit for making the purchase (not sure what promotion it was since I didn't see it) and we got $1 toward Amazon MP3s. So our foolishness was credited, but before you buy this always remember that it airs on tv every year (in our case 3 days after we purchased it). If we had checked our TV guide we would have seen it and been able to record it for free. Buyer beware.Don't buy it."
Neutral,"Some reviewers here have complained that the pillow flattens too easily. Note that according to the web site sitincomfort (The Comfort Store), there are two kinds of Comfort U pillows: one is stuffed with Fusion Fiberfill, and the other is stuffed with Fossfill. The Fusion Fiberfill is what's being sold on this Amazon page. Read carefully; other Amazon sellers stock the Fossfill version.This is an important point to consider, depending on your priorities. My understanding is that the Fusion Fiberfill is supposed to feel more like a real down pillow--which means it's likely to need to be fluffed more, too. Tricky with such a big pillow.So I recomend doing a little research and checking out the Fossfill version. The Fossfill version is allegedly better at maintaining its shape, and also lets air circulate better so it's not as hot."
Neutral,"My wife purchased this item after all the great reviews and after using another, less supportive product. She likes the overall design but after a few weeks of use, despite the lifetime guarantee of the pillow retaining its fluffiness, found that the dependent portions of the pillow at the sides lost their fluffiness. If the product had, say a firm foam core, it would probably be perfect."
Positive,"You'd have to be crazy to purchase a full-priced replacement adapter directly from Apple. Third-party is the way to go here, and this Macally adapter is a great value overall.Pros: Cheap as heck, long cord, does what it's supposed to do.Cons: Cord does not easily wind up. If my PowerBook G4 is totally out of juice, the Macally needs to charge it for a few minutes before the computer will power itself up again."
Negative,"I've now been through three of these cords. they seem to last around a year before just dying. The first two eventually had fatal connection issues with the piece that connects to the computer, however my third one has just died and is actually not getting any power from the wall. The little indicator just fades out, and now won't come on at all. Yes it's a lot cheaper than the other cords, but I'm just not sure its better. I know lots of people have problems with the apple cords as well."
Neutral,"It works but what I received was not as shown, the cable did not detach from the transformer brick on the thin side."
Positive,"I had to replace the Apple adapter that came with my laptop and this is a sturdy and relatively cheap alternative to buying another Apple one. Of course, it's not as aesthetically pleasing and it doesn't have the convenient green/orange indicator light, but it does it's job. I haven't had any problems with it. I recommend it highly."
Neutral,My original power adapter gave up the ghost after about two years. With a replacement costing $80 I was motivated to try this adapter. At first it appeared more durable and I only missed the lighted rim of the original a little bit. After about a year and a half the Macally adapter has started to go out (it no longer connects well where the cable from the laptop meets the transformer).At less than half the cost of the Apple product and with few other options I'm buying another. It's the best option I can find. My Powerbook is going strong into year five but it's doing so on its third adapter.
Negative,"Bought this about a month ago as a back-up adaptor. When used on my Powerbook G4 and my wife's iBook G4, it does not charge them when in operation. It supplies power so that the units are functional when plugged in, but it will only charge the units when they are closed or turned off. I'd give this a one star, but at least it powers them when they're on, even without the charging."
Positive,"Searched Hi/Low for this item. Similar products were 5 X more expensive. So far, it works like a charm!Would recommend it to anyone!Grayfox442"
Negative,"I received a different adapter so I cannot really tell you about the Macally adapter. I received an adapter from Inspire and it does not have the longer cord, the velcro strap or the led lights. But it does charge my computer and it arrived quickly."
Very Negative,"I bought this charger thinking that it would be compatible with my late 2005 iBook G4. The description page has nothing stating that it is not for ibook G4 but only for Powerbook G4 and ibook G3. Also, after only about 3 weeks of use the charger died completely. This is by far the worst charger I have ever had. Pros: quick ship Cons: incorrect description, lack of durability"
Negative,"I bought this because it was a cheaper alternative to Mac's (ridiculously priced)$80 charger. At first it worked pretty good, but about a week or two after i got it it seems to not be working like it should. i think there is some kind of warranty, so i should try and exchange it...but sometimes when it is plugged into my computer it will charge for one second, then stop for one second, charge for one second, stop for one second, etc. It still manages to charge the computer, but im not sure if all this on\off stuff is necessarily good for my computer..."
Positive,"At half the price of the original Apple adapter, this is a good value. That said, I do miss the lcd ring around the plug of the Apple adapter, the one that glows green or orange depending on if the laptop is fully charged or is currently charging. It's useful to discern at a glance if I can take my laptop and go without wondering if it's fully charged. Also, the glowing ring would indicate that it IS charging -- sometimes the other end of the electrical plug will come loose, and I wouldn't be aware that the computer isn't charging if it wasn't for the light. However, being on a limited budget, the lcd ring is a sacrifice I'd make to save nearly $40."
Positive,"Use it to power my G4 PowerBook. Functionally it has been perfect. I don't travel with it, so I don't mind its somewhat unwieldy size and shape. If I did, I'd want a smaller adapter, like the (more expensive) one made by Apple."
Neutral,"understand that this was bought for my 16 year old son. he was thrilled when it arrived, it got his computer back to working right away. of course then he did something that broke the computer so he only used it for about a week. that said, when i took the cable and tried to work on his computer, i discovered that in the short time we'd had the adapter he'd mangled the plug where it goes into the computer. not such that it didn't go back in with some effort, but that's not a good sign in my book for such a short amount of use. so my word of caution, be really careful with it, else you could have trouble down the line. too bad the cowl isn't nice & stiff like an RCA plug, that would solve the problem..."
Neutral,"Beware: NOT compatible with the aluminum Powerbook, even though it says so on the packaging. Will simply not work (flickering screen, charge on and off).As someone else mentioned before, this AC adapter is NOT compatible with all aluminum Powerbooks, despite what you might be led to believe on this seller's page. I'd call customer service before purchasing this item with the serial # of your laptop handy (click the top left apple, ""about this mac"", then ""more info"") and get specific confirmation that this can supply power to your computer.I'm still giving it 3 stars though, since the shipping was really fast, and customer service was very nice/knowledgeable, giving me a complete refund for my purchase (including S&H;, etc)."
Negative,"I had the original Apple charger that came with my Powerbook G4. It lasted me about a year and a half. I opted for this Macally charger, for two reasons, 1. the price 2. the great reviews on Amazon. I have had the charger for less the 6 months and it is already non-functional. Yes it is cheaper than the Apple charger, but it really comes out to the same price, considering that an apple charger costs about $90 and lasts 1 1/2 years and the Macally costs $30 and lasts six months."
Very Negative,"I bought this plug as a substitute to replace the Apple one that blew out. Unfortunately, this plug seems to have problems. I noticed that it heats up really badly when plugged into some plug outlets and causes my laptop to heat up as well. Once, I also heard some noise coming from my iBook G4 that wasn't there before. This noise went away when I unplugged the power cord. What I'm most upset about though is that it seems to have shortened the battery life of my computer to about 50% now! I think I should have bought the Apple plug instead."
Very Positive,"I miss the lighted ring telling you that the charger is charging, but for 1/2 of the price of Apple's replacement, I can do without it!The LED iS BRIGHT, and cool bluish color. The cable that breaks on Apple's charger is noticeably thicker on this charger.Get this. You'll not regret it."
Neutral,The price was right and it allows me to continue to use my computer but it charges and drains must faster than the original.
Positive,"The construction is solid, and the device has no serious shortcomings aside from it's 50w power output which limits it's usefulness for 15"" powerbook users. I use this as my travel adapter and because of it's lower power output than the standard 65w adapter the computer does not charge if I am using it heaviliy."
Positive,"This product is a beaute....just missing one thing, a status indicator light to know when battery is charged.You'd think with the cool blue LCD light, it would have been easy to incorporate into the design.Product doesn't get hot as did original Apple..."
Neutral,"It does the job.. Poor quality product, but you get what you pay for. It does what it is suppose to after fiddling with it. Connections have a lot to be desired, but again, the price is right. If you can afford it always go for the OEM equipment you'll be a lot happier. If cheap is what you need this will work for ya.."
Very Positive,"Initially I was going to give this power adapter 4 stars because it lacks that charge light that the Apple adapters have, but you just can't beat the price. It is an ideal and inexpensive replacement or companion adapter. You could by a few of these for the cost of just one from Apple. The only thing to take notice is that it may not charge a laptop as quickly as the standard Apple power adapter because of it's lower wattage.Pros:- Inexpensive- Inexpensive- Inexpensive- Durable- Velcro cord wrapCons:- No charge status light- Lower wattage then Apple adapter- Slightly larger then the standard Apple adapter"
Negative,"This book doesn't even come close to the quality I have come to expect from Maeve Binchy. The story lines never come together. Basically, the entire book is a set of character sketches. Yes, it kept my attention and I did finish the book, but by the time I was finished, I regretted spending the time on it and fussed at my mother who told me in advance that this was not one of her favorites. (She should have been a bit more forthcoming!) I would not recommend this book; on the contrary, I would discourage someone from investing any time on this book. There are many, many better books out there, including all others by still-a-favorite Maeve Binchy."
Very Positive,This was heart-rending and displayedthe same finesse at fully roundedcharacters with their issues. The priest'sdiscoveries and how he dealt with themwere particularly poignant.
Neutral,"This is a collection of six interlinked stories about a family preparing for the parent's silver wedding anniversary, it gives a description of some of the family and also some of the closer friends who will be attending the wedding. We have Anna the oldest daughter, she is organising the anniversary party, and worried about what can go wrong and whether her brother Brendan will show up at the party. Brendan has all but removed himself from the family as he is tired of the acting that goes on with his mother Deirdre who's always worried about what people will think. Theres also Anna and Brendan's sister Helen a very confused, accident prone and annoying character who is trying to become a nun to get away from it all. There's the parish priest who has his own secrets and other various family and friends.This is a short book which I read in a few hours. I think if you have read the Lilac Bus and liked it you will probably like this one as well."
Positive,"My mom is the Maeve Binchy reader in the family. She loves all her books. When I asked her how she liked this book, she said it was pretty good and written in the typical Maeve Binchy style. Hope you enjoy it as well!"
Positive,"Rated for 3+ but my 2 and 3 yr. olds both play with this. While the kids like playing with this, I like that it can grow with them. It has basic tools for younger children: rolling pin, presser with three tips, pizza cutter, safety scissors, play-doh knife. But it also has tools/items for older ones: bead making, art molds for pictures and ""sand"".The only con is the mat. It's cheap plastic. Sounded great on the box in the store, but ends up crinkled underneath them and not protecting the floor. Stick with using and old sheet or vinyl table cloth from the $1 store."
Very Positive,"This DVD more than fufilled my expectations. Great performances of some of the best tunes I know.Yes Geoff Tate was a little bit of a ham - but it worked and worked well. I don't understand what people expect. Enjoy the band, enjoy the songs, enjoy the spectacle - and relax already!"
Negative,"This corkscrew is poorly made, consisting of low-grade stampings and flimsy plastic molded parts assembled with tinned rivets. It feels like it's going to come apart in your hand, and it requires considerable care to use it safely and effectively. It's outrageously overpriced, too. An unfortunate product offering from the company that brought us the legendary original Screwpull, perhaps the handiest corkscrew ever.I did manage to pull a cork with it, though - which is why it gets even two stars."
Very Negative,"I thought this book was the worst book ever. It was so boring! Did I mention that it was the WORST BOOK EVER!!!! It was the worst book in the history of bad books. You should never read it. Take my word on that. Oh, and I didn't just choose to read it on my own. A teacher forced me to read the dumb novel. IT'S THE WORST BOOK EVER!!!!!!!"
Neutral,"This movie is about an idealistic guy(Dharmendra) and his street smart pickpocket friend(Shatrughan Sinha). Shatru was not a big star at the time and is in a supporting role but he thoroughly chews up and outshines Dharmendra. When I watched the movie, I was completely surprised by Shatru's comic talents. He rocks big-time as the wisecracking immoral thug. Watch out for the scene when Shatru goes to the employment office to seek job (after being coerced by Dharam) and his interaction with the officer there. Alas, his comic talents weren't quite explored by any other director and this guy himself started hamming in the later stages of his career. This is among Shatru's two finest performances('Mere Apne' being the other one). Watch it for Shatru. The movie is a joyride and Shatru makes it work."
Very Positive,"From introduction to ending this work is one that kept me interested and coming back for more. Lundberg's writings mentally transport readers to experiences and places that quickly spring to life. The book engendered mental pictures that demanded my attention and created a storyline that melded both old and new into an experience that evoked strong memories and visions of bustling cities, ancient fortresses, and brightly colored umbrella topped tables lining village streets . I could almost feel the humidity and heat as he revealed a place and a time that has reverberated throughout history. Ulysses has never been recounted like this! And, the story with its modern approach to describing the people of Greece and the 'Greek Experience' is right on the money!"
Very Negative,"I had another infrared massager before this one that I used for years to help with sore muscles and a nasty TMJ condition. It finally shorted out and I bought this product just a few weeks ago. I had one of the worst headaches of my entire life yesterday and was using this on my jaw when I most unfortunately fell asleep. I guess muscle relaxers and vicodin will do that to you. Anyway, when I woke up, I found that I had rolled over and the infrared massager was underneath my pillow. It completely melted and burned through my sheets and a couple inches into my mattress. I had fallen asleep a few times with my other infrared massager with no consequences so this surprised and dismayed me. This is not a safe product - it either needs to be made of sturdier material than cheap plastic or have a timer on it - I would certainly be willing to pay the extra money to not have to worry about setting fire to my house or burning myself. Sorry - can't recommend it."
Positive,"This is a GREAT CD from a GREAT fiddler!! This is the kind of album that you don't want to put down! Pierre and his band play everything from Irish, Scottish, Quebecois, to Swing (and MORE!) If you're looking for a good fiddle cd, or just want good music, GET THIS ALBUM!"
Positive,Martha Black's story showed her love of the Yukon. She was a pioneer in a country that required unique skills and much courage.
Very Positive,"I had always heard that this short story by W.W.Jacobs was one of the great classic Victorian ghost stories. I was recently reminded of it when Stephen King mentioned it in his new e-book, ""Riding the Bullet"". So, alas! - I finally got my hands on it, and it is indeed worthy of it's acclaim. A visitor brings a magickal talisman - a monkey's paw - to his hosts' home; the macabre dismembered simian apendage is charmed with the ability to grant wishes. But the visitor who leaves the object with his hosts, also leaves their premises with a strong warning of the outcome of the things wished for."
Neutral,"Kozena has a pretty voice with good intonation, but it is still undeveloped and sometimes breathy. I don't think she is a Mezzo-Soprano, and these choices are the wrong literature for her. Singing 19th century music in a Baroque style does not do the drama justice. I think Kozena does herself, and the world, a disservice, by not practicing and developing her higher soprano notes. Remember that Joan Sutherland once sang Mezzo-Soprano, but changed her focus to Soprano, calling her mezzo days ""a lazy soprano""."
Positive,"Sue Bender is an artist who first learned of the Amish through their remarkable quilts. Not satisfied to learn about them second hand, she was able through great perserverance to stay with two Amish families. Plain and Simple not only recounts these visits, it also chronicles Bender's own search for meaning, simplicity, and order.Bender's book was first published in 1989 and is considered a classic. It is well worth reading."
Positive,"This book was a great book to pick up and read while waiting for children at music lessons. I would like to go back and read it again and make some notes in the side bars. A book you could read again, and again and come out with something else learned."
Very Negative,"This book is 'just okay.' I came away from reading the book not knowing too much about the Amish. Sue prefers to keep most of the information to herself. She does, however, make sure she gets in adequate writing about all of her 'accomplishments' -- and makes apparent her desire to return to her old life of those accomplishments. (Big hairy deal!) Personally I think she's a bore....and a boor; actually I found her to be pompous. She had a wonderful idea which could have been made better. Sue Bender, you need to grow up."
Neutral,"These are nifty little fellas, but they do 'leak' a bit, so you either have to get something else to set them on or make sure everyone always hangs them upside down.They tend to forget, and then you have a mess on the floor.I would have considered giving four stars, but the magnets don't do any good if there is nothing for them to 'cling' to, and because they do leak. But they are cute and somewhat handy.Oh, and they could grind a wee bit better. But not bad overall."
Negative,"As light weight sci-fi/horror anthologies go this is probably good value for money (given its low price), but the apparent lack of good editing and of proper proof reading is painfully evident and you definitely won't find any candidate for a Hugo or Nebula award.You'll find a couple of interesting ideas, a lot of trite and derivative ones and occasionally some baffling lack of coherent character development.There's enough to show that Messrs. Jason Brannon, Eric S. Brown and John Grover have the potential to write something good, but it seems to be, at the moment at least, unfulfilled potential."
Positive,Logically enough Professor Herrick begins with an overview of his subject. He concludes with some of the better known modern rhetoricians. In between these two chapters he traces the history of the field and the various contributors. Timelines in the chapters enable the reader to see where the content of that particular section fits in the overall scheme. Sources are clearly identified throughout the book. Sidebars are another asset found in each section.The glossary in the back of the book is a ready reference for students seeking to quickly understand a term. Herrick seeks to combine modern example with ancient methodology in some places. Generally speaking this book introduces the subject well. It is clear and comprehensive. I have used with favorable results as a textbook when I was teaching in Massachusetts.
Very Positive,"This is an excellent resource for scouting baseball players for the upcoming season. Literally you get this book for $15, and compared with the magazines you get for $8, it is a great value. The book is full of stats you can't get anywhere else. Some in particular that I find valuable are the Groundball Percentages and new 'Stuff' rankings for pitchers.They also don't just give you numbers, but supply you with a scouting report on pretty much any player who is likely to play in the majors in the upcoming season including minor leaguers.Easily worth the $15 if you are trying to win a fantasy baseball league."
Neutral,"My 5 year old son loves I Spy, so the Easter bunny brought him this collection of 4 I Spy books in one volume. He is a beginning reader, and the pictures next to the words help to reinforce his reading skills. That said, the searches are pretty easy for him. His 3 year old sister breezes through them quickly as well using the pictures in the list. They like to race to see who can find the objects fastest, but they have both mastered the entire volume since Easter, just over a week ago."
Very Positive,"Chopper Girl is on fire! This album, her debut, is packed full of topics, tempos, lyrics, collabos, and crunkness! This woman is living proof that Memphis Rap is NOT dead, but alive, well, and thriving! There wasn't a song on this album that I didn't like. I'm telling you, ""Dirty Dolla$"" is a MUST have for all the TRUE Memphis Rap Bumpers."
Very Negative,"I find this books to be incredibly disrespectful of it's own contents. The information is at best laughable and at worst horrifyingly stupid.Others have mentioned the concept of the 'new' triple Deities(as everyone knows that you can create deities just by reading about them in a book and wanting them to exist *real* hard). I also found the concept that these deities would be thrilled with offerings of trash and garbage particularly 'interesting'(by which I mean nonsensical and silly.)This book is garbage of the lowest common denominator. A sheer money grab by a person who lives in a self created commune in a rural area. If I could chose one book to permanently remove from all bookstores and shelves this would be seriously in the running for that spot. Dare I say it - worse then SWR if only because everyone knows she writes garbage whereas people, for some reason, think this is the best stuff ever."
Very Negative,"First of all you have to already have a pretty stiff erection to get this thing on. Secondly, we've used it twice and the third time we went to use it one of the dolphin heads split apart from the main ring. We've washed it both times we used it with toy cleaner - nothing harsh. It's cheaply made and the batteries do not last at all. Once it was on it really didn't do what it is supposed to do - it's more awkward than anything. Definitely would not recommend."
Very Positive,This is a great pattern for a special occasion or every day use... well worth it!!!
Positive,"Perfect for anyone who wants to read Goethe's peotry in German and understand it as well. For those familar with the German language, Goethe isn't the easiest writer to understand in German."
Very Positive,"If you are interested in Renaissance Italy, gender studies, or the history of the Christian Church, this book is for you. This book presents the story of an ambitious abbess on the road to sainthood a la Catherine of Siena and her fall from grace as she becomes too powerful for the comfort of her male collegues. It is the story of the making and unmaking of a saint. This is one of my favorite books of all time."
Neutral,I read a lot about this period in history so this book was a bit out of the ordinary but interesting.
Very Negative,"According to the specifications this headset supports Bluetooth 1.2, as well as the Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP) and the Audio Video Remote Control Profile (AVRCP). I could not get any sound to come out when connected with my Sony Ericsson w600i in phone or Walkman mode, and people could not hear me when I called them. I tried every setting possible, read the instructional booklets for each device and the thing still wouldn't to anything when connected. I am guessing that this headset works fantastically with any Motorola device, but as far as I'm concerned this product is guilty of false advertising. After this experience I do not plan on buying any Motorola Bluetooth devices."
Very Positive,"Cold Dog Soup is typical Guy Clark; literate, tuneful, wry, funny, brilliantly crafted, wonderfully played. Opening with the title tune, Clark's images invade your mind and don't let you go. Fort Worth Blues and Sis Draper follow inviting the listener on a journey with a group of fascinating characters. Men will be boys takes a playful putdown and turns it into a celebration of helling around sung as a bunch of guys having way too much fun.""The only difference between men and the boysis the size of their feet and the price of their toys""Very well played, lots of great guitar and mandolin playing. Highly recommend"
Very Positive,"A much needed refresher of what makes our country great, the philosophy our founders found to be crucial to the makings of a republic."
Positive,"Nice suspense, unexpected story line that leaves reader wondering about a conclusion . Good characters and setting descriptions. Any true western affciano will enjoy the fighting and promise of action.Dan G"
Positive,I bought this as a replacement board for a 10 y/o opener. The original board was permanently fastened to the opener chassis and had to be cut off. I then had to drill holes in the side of the opener and fasten the new board with two screws. Unfortunately Liftmaster uses the same exact stock numbers without indicating that there were changes made. In the end it works perfectly but is no job for amateurs.
Very Positive,"i've owned this cd for years, and it keeps returning to my now playing selection. its wonderful to listen to in the morning as i'm waking up, while i'm reading, or just feeling extremely lazy. i highly recommend it."
Very Positive,"Thanks to amazon.com I found this record. It is one of the rare records you can play over and over without boring. Only this fact merits five stars. It sometimes reminds me to Haris Alexiou (greek female artist). I recommend this CD to anyone who is searching for an intriguing sound not influenced by marketing. I cannot describe, just listen, and you'll know what I mean."
Very Positive,"Esta genial este compact.. Sin tener conocimiento previo del grupo nadie pudiera adivinar la nacionalidad de los artistas.. tiene obvias influencias españolas pero a la vez un son latino y un giro primermundista en su filosofia. Resulta que es una Judia-Mexicana-Americana-Canadiense.. indescribible su musica, utiliza lluvia, guitarra, y mil sonidos para expresarse."
Neutral,Except for being very much likeThe Indian in the Cupboardthe book has a sword and sorcery type theme.The adventure is fun and the characters are believable.I liked the book and thought it was fun reading.The diagram of the castle was also educational;pretty small for a Keep. Most real castles were much larger than this.
Very Positive,"This book was the best book to read it kept me on the edge of my seat! I couln't wait to finish and to see what happened and when it ended i wanted to read it again. If you like fantasies i would highly recement this book. It's about a boy named William and his ""nanny"" and very close friend gave him a castle and he adored it! When he relized that the castle had secrets to learn he became a part of the castle. If you want to know more than bye the book!!"
Very Positive,Spellbinder was the first book I read by Lisa Smith. It made me read all of the Night World series not to mention buy all her others!! I like reading books about withcraft and if you do you will love this book. It was great!! So read it!!
Neutral,"the hose end for the wall connection was over sized, i had to sand it down with emery cloth to make it fit properly, otherwise the hose was good"
Very Positive,"Finally replaced our 20+ year old central vac hose with this one and WOW...what a difference! The handle and the on/off switch really take a lot of effort out of this chore. Highly recommend!! Now, if only someone would invent an easy way of storing these things!"
Positive,Game was in excellent condition. It is not as much fun as the true tomb raider series as it has no secret passages nor many surprises.
Negative,"This game was nothing but glitchy on my PC. I have no problem with a dozen or so other games from other companies (including Deus Ex 2, also from Eidos), but this one is a turkey. It's glitchy, the controls are too clunky, and whenever I exited the game my PC restarted. The built-in EAX support didn't work with my Sound Blaster Audigy 2 (which uses the EAX 4 drivers), I had to install the EAX 3 drivers that came with the game, which was essentially a downgrade for me.On the other hand, this game looks great and when the sound worked it was terrific. The story is pretty cool, and I was looking forward to see how it played out. The cutscenes were good, and I felt like it was as much an interactive movie as it was a game.Unfortunately, I couldn't take the bugginess, so I didn't finish the game. Avoid this one and spend your money on one of the earlier Tomb Raider titles."
Very Negative,"I can hardly wait for this game and now another disappointment,why don't they be truthful and say when for sure so I can get on with some other game..just waiting with baited-breath, and how long will we have to wait for another after this one,, they need to get with it before I outgrow my need for Laura and I'm only 75 , can't wait much longer, if you know what I mean!!!"
Negative,"Cutting edge technology does not a great game make. This game is proof.The graphics are beautiful, which accounts for the extra star for the overall rating. If you are a Tomb Raider fan, you will absolutely hate this game, as I do. The controls, the plot, and the movements are maddening, boring and confusing, respectively. Eidos could plug Tomb Raider 1 into this engine and have a much more interesting game.Maxim magazine gave this game 5 stars. A good reason to ignore Maxim's ratings."
Positive,"Yes, there are parts that are a bit tricky. If you don't like a challenge don't bother with it but it is very involving and well laid out. Great story line with wonderfully interactive characters all providing enough clues and goodies to keep the game moving.If you like intelligent, challenging games then this one will be for you, otherwise just stick with the kiddie stuff."
Very Negative,Got this JUNK from the Thank You network. It failed even the assembly test - the thing is so badly manufactured that the connection to which the pressure hose connects on the body of the washer was completely misaligned. There was no way I could connect the nozzle. OK - I thought it happens. I tried to call their 1-800-521-8559 support number and was on hold for 42 Minutes both on the Customer Service and Sales lines and then they cut me off. I did not even talk to a human! Their website is a joke. This is a typical bottom of the barrel Chinese company trying to dump poorly built stuff on the consumer. DO NOT BUY this and encourage such companies that dont give a hoot about the customer.I'm returning this and telling every retailer to dump this.AM
Negative,"Find another version for ebookery, or go hard copy on this one. The table of contents, like the print version, organizes Poe's work into general categories, but stops there. Absent is a listing of the stories themselves, which is available in the print version. Navigating to a particular story requires you to do a search. Penguin charges a premium for a poor publishing job here."
Neutral,"I think it was emotional and she was sick and really ill after catching a chill on a beach,the authoris mourning the death of his lover.in my opinion it was sad,but a great book.there is alot of romance. It was kind of hard toread because i'm only 9 and I had to have someone explain the story to me."
Positive,"My son was covering ""bugs"" in preschool, so I picked up this book. Knowing it was going to be really for older kids, I wasnt sure he was going to like it. These books are so well designed however that for 2 weeks now, he requests the ""bug"" book every night before bed. The only problem is that the pictures are so detailed and zoomed in that some of the images gives my wife and I the heebeegeevees.The other great thing, is that this book will be a great book from him to grow into.We are picking up more!"
Positive,"I have an avid seven year old reader. With all the little captions and detailed drawing, etc- he has been reading and rereading this book and loving it."
Very Negative,"The description on the website says it has an 11-inch dome, that's why I was willing to pay the high premium for the cake stand. But when it arrived I carefully measured the dome and it was only 10-inches. You can get a 10-inch one and it cost LESS THAN HALF as much (search ""diner cake stand""). DON'T FALL FOR IT!"
Negative,"I'm sorry to say this CD is not very representative of Jewish liturgical music in England. There are far too many modern pieces by contemporary Jewish composers, many of which would be considered quite out of place in an actual English synagogue service, particularly of the more traditional style. The leading composers of the Anglo-Jewish liturgical tradition such as Samuel Alman and Abraham Saqui are very poorly represented; even Israel Mombach, the English equivalent of Solomon Sulzer or Louis Lewandowski, only has 3 pieces on the album - and only one of those is typical. Finally, several of the pieces are instrumental (for organ) without any singing at all, which has little relevance to the choral music of the album's title.I have heard the Zemel Choir live, and on this CD they seem rather recessed and timid. Overall, a disappointing release."
Negative,"I read a previous review that said hers got a run the first time she used them and I figured I'd just be more careful...mine got a run the second time I used them! Unless you're desperate, don't bother. I expected better quality for the price I paid!"
Very Positive,"A humorous account of the author's travels circa 1983 to the remaining possessions of the British Empire, almost all of which are isolated islands. Several of the tiffs with British bureaucrats read like episodes of British sitcoms. My only complaint is that the bibliography at the end was not updated for the re-issue and is composed entirely of books which are more than 20 years old."
Negative,"I cannot believe that this book has won awards. I like certain passages; Ms. Scott's imagery is often good and the ""mood"" is earthy and dark. However, overall it was disappointing. I just finished it and I could hardly wait to put it down and move onto something more interesting. Ms. Scott desperately tries to make her characters more than cardboard cutouts, but she never manages to succeed. I found myself not caring about the fate of any of these people or the house they lived in (which is really the main ""character"" of the book).The author has mastery of language but the story, like the mounted animals in the book, is merely the pretty arrangement of skin with no guts inside. No life."
Very Negative,"I purchased this on a whim because, hey, I like Billie Holiday... so remixes could be fun, right? I couldn't have been more wrong. What was done to this music can only be described as a travesty at best - an ugly cacophony of cheap electro beats over Billie's beautiful voice. This could have been done well. There's great potential, but this? Not even passable. Don't even give this one a second glance."
Neutral,This product is great if what you are using it for isn't too heavy or lopsided. The frame is very flimsy but with a few modifications like clamps to hold the upper circle in place and a weld to hold the supports together it is a very useful item for picking up leaf debris or even heavier items like wet trash.
Very Negative,The directions to put this together were unclear and failed to note that you need to use really oversized bags. After a few uses the sides have already broken. The clips are really hard to put on and off the the rack.
Positive,"Confusing to assemble; also, tighten screws well, or you'll lose the, and will have to replace at the hardware store.But once you get you get it together, it works well."
Neutral,"The synopsis on the back of this edition misspells one of the main character's names, Will Farnaby. It says 'Faranby' two different times. Hopefully someone has done something about this by now."
Very Positive,"wonderful book, recommend this to anyone looking for a great novel to sit and get lost in... check it out!"
Negative,"I have read enough to know when I'm being preached to, and Huxley is unsuccessful in masking his assertions re: the human condition in The Island. I was very disappointed, since Huxley has the ability to write well, even about esoteric subjects (see The Perennial Philosophy, for instance), but ends up just making a hash of it here. Not highly recommended."
Negative,"The synopsis of this book sounded spectacular, a conspiring journalist gets stuck on a utopian island. The book starts off kind of entertaining but with a bit of rambling but you figure as you go on, it will probably subside. It doesn't. The characters keep going on and on about buddhism, sex and mushrooms. The plot barely starts and barely ends. This is a book with no journey and no destination."
Very Positive,A man arrives on an Island to engineer an oil deal. He begins to like the place. It is a nice place. But one of the old money family wants to sell it out for greater access to the contents of a Sears-Roebuck catalog. In the end evil triumphs because good is pacifist and big oil money can buy more guns.
Positive,"Like in his famous novel ""Brave New World"", this is a utopian story, however in this case it is not a negative Utopia. Set on a tropical island and told from the point of view of a jaded journalist secretly helping an oil company interested in concessions, it explores Buddhist religion and possible alternatives to our lifestyle. No great revelations, but then, noone has the answers. A good read for Huxley fans and people who enjoy utopian stories"
Very Negative,Disappointing. Very. Nothing happens. Huxley pontificates. Spare me. Can see why he's only known for one book. Skip this one.
Very Negative,"I found this book annoying. It probably has some good points, and even some helpful points, but I was annoyed with the tone of voice of the author. Give parents some credit, for heaven's sake! I read a group of 10 books about teaching gifted children, and there are so many better choices that I would not recommend this one."
Very Negative,"A woman (with a child in a state of perpetual tantrum) straps a camera to a stroller to see who will help her carry it. This is a video about how one person's poor planning can become everyone's problem! I looked for the story in it, but couldn't find one, so I shut it off."
Negative,"This book doesn't make sense. I am pretty sure Christians already have a Top 10 list if you know what I mean. I bet THE MAN is pretty upset about this. James Moore went all Casey Kasem on him and tried to trump HIS list. Anyway, it's your call, but I think I'm sticking with the list that dates back to B.C. and has guided the morals of man ever since, while playing a major role the development of early legal systems which has an impact present in almost all forms of modern law and faith.Nice try James Moore."
Very Negative,It is an excellent concept completely spoiled by bad design!In the heat of the battle an extra click on already selected group can select ALL of you troups and instead a single move/attack you have all your army moving to a position. In this time the CPU kills you with ease.There is no EASY way to tell the arches to shoot a specific target. Especially if there are 10 enemy troops rushing towards you in a pack. As a result they don't shoot the critical ladders but some stupid axeman. Short while after that you have all the ladders on your walls and in a minute all the enemy army is in your camp. Even if you survive this then it is real pain to target the ladders on the walls. You can spend a minute to shoot down one and the CPU does not wait that much.THIS IS A WASTE OF TIME!
Negative,"I agree with the review dated March 14, 1999. I'd also like to add that as of Chapter 2, I've found at least three misprints in the solutions manual. Normally, these types of mistakes are not that much of a problem. But this should be unacceptable for any decent technical writing, especially mathematics."
Positive,"Thought the football would be a bit larger, but that would be my fault for not ""reading""... cute, fun and very loud!!!"
Positive,Hi! Ok well I just ordered this book again for a niece of mine. I have the book at home and I just love it the instructions are so easy to follow! I would recomend this to anyone who loves beautiful fashionable jewlery!
Very Negative,If you are a John Denver fan this disk will make you cry and not for the reasons you might expect. I turned it off after 5 tracks because I couldn't bare to listen to it any more. I had the feeling that someone had rummaged through some old discarded session tapes and had played them back through a pillow. The arrangements were definitely not what I was expecting and the quality was awful. I gave this recoding 1 star but only because they wouldn't let me out of the screen without filling in that field!
Neutral,"I ordered a particular size and was sent the wrong size. Returning the jeans to the USA from Belgium at my own expense is not really an option. Unfortunately the seller claimed the error was mine and that it sent the size I ordered. The problem is, when you check the status of the order on the Amazon site, it gives you every detail of your order - date, type of product, quantity, price, expected delivery date. BUT IT DOES NOT INCLUDE DETAILS OF THE SIZE YOU ORDERED. So, you have no proof that it is the seller's error not your own. So, I have 2 pairs of jeans that don't fit me."
Positive,"I am 5'5"" and about 160 lbs. I got the size Queen 1 because of the reviews saying to get a size up since they cut into your thigh. I am wearing these with a garter belt under a dress so I needed them to fit comfortably. I got nude, and I am very pale and the color works. They aren't too shiny either. This size is supposed to fit up to 225 lbs and 5'6"" and they fit pretty well on my thigh but the lace band sits pretty low. It starts just a few inches above my knee, so keep that in mind. You will need adjustable garter straps and a knee length dress. I can't wait to try these on with my garter and dress!"
Very Positive,I've owned this specific set of china for the past 6 years and absolutely love it!!! I've had no problems of chipping or cracking and the set is used and placed into the dishwasher on a regular basis. I fell in love with the pattern and it doesn't disappoint! Another fine product from Mikasa.
Very Positive,"Both of these issues, among others, are examined in this simple yet complex story about a variety of characters, all of whom we recognize.What lies beneath the skin of the average person? What do they believe in, and why? What makes their worlds shatter? What would make your world shatter?The author never wastes a word, entertwining the characters in unlikely but believable ways. It's a quick read that lingers with the reader, to make you think about your beliefs, and what you would do for those beliefs.To each individual, the book could be about God, or the meaning of life, or simply how you fit into the world. This makes the book touching on a personal level. I think every reader will find a different way, and reason, to love this book."
Neutral,"In this story, Hyacinth is a woman who is faced with one of the most horrible moments in a mother's life: she is forced to give up her two children for a moment of craziness she already regrets.Faced with an incredible emptiness, she is able, with the help of a total stranger, to rebuild her life. what once seemed an impossibility becomes her career and she is good at it.The story is interesting and the plot keeps you interested till the end. It makes a good summer reading."
Positive,I was hooked from the first page to this novel. It wasn't until the last 30 pages that I had an idea of how this might end. I really enjoyed the read. I read alot and really enjoyed this one
Neutral,"If I hadn't read other books by Belva Plain, I would give this book 5 stars. It was a good book, but she has done so much better in books like Evergreen and Legacy of Silence. This was a fast read (I did it in 3 days, along with working 8 hours each day and studying) and I was wrapt until the middle of the book, when I realized exactly what was going to happen. I finished the book, with hopes that I was incorrect. I was disappointed with the transparent climax, but overall this is worthwhile, especially if you haven't read any of Plain's greater works or can forget that you have."
Positive,"Great deal for the price. I have not had a chance to use it yet, as I could not find a set in my budget until fireplace season was over. However, my 12yr old was able to easily assemble the set and it looks nice and feels sturdy."
Very Negative,"The subject is trivial and boring. The writing skill mediocre.I was stuck in Sri Lanka and downloaded it by mistake when learning how to use my new kindle. Decided to take a look.Sorry, perhaps just not my type of book. It is no literature."
Very Negative,I got this as a free selection. It was so incredibly boring and I could not finish it. Don't waste any amount of money on it.
Positive,"Although I read this book many years ago I recall that it is a well-written and engaging examination of women's sexuality. The difficulties that many young women face as they mature into fully functioning sexual adults - as mitigated by their upbringings as well as the varied expectations of society and their partners - are nicely illustrated through a series of real life case studies. The author, Dr. Bardon, was a teaching and research member of the faculty of the University of Minnesota from the early 1960s through the late 1990s. Some of the book will undoubtedly be dated, but much of it is just as relevant -...- today as when it was written in the mid 1970s. As used copies are readily available through Amazon.com I highly recommend picking one up."
Very Negative,I couldn't. The quality of this DVD is horrible! It was like watching an old old old VHS tape. I'm not surprised it was so cheap but I'm shocked that it was rated 4 and a half stars when I bought it. I was taken for a ride and it wasn't on the back of a horse.
Negative,"There's a reason this thing is $15. It's made of ultra-cheap material and it shows from a mile. The stones look to be collected from around some highway. In addition to that, mine had an unbalanced stand which made it jiggle when playing with the sand. I returned it and will keep looking for something that is not an embarrassment when noticed by coworkers."
Very Negative,"Like other reviewers, my zen garden arrived with the bottom falling apart. Had I tried to add the sand, it would have poured out the bottom. It was so visibly defective that I'm shocked that it made it out of the factory. I sent it back."
Negative,"I can't believe I wasted my money on this! When I got the product, I had before-hand read some reviews about it falling apart or something. So, before I wasted the sand that came with it and caused a mess, I gently pressed on the wood/base part. It was flimsy, but I didn't think much of it. Then, while just doing a quick look over, I noticed that there was a small disconect between the bottom base and the black lining. This would cause the sand to leak out of the crack! Then, the base fell write off! I noticed that it had very tiny, small metal pieces that had wood from the base around it. I now realize that they probably put the metal into it, painted the top black, then pushed on the base to connect the two parts. The little ""stubs"" that hold it up have superglue stains from where they glued it to the bottom of the base. How cheap! I really don't know what to do now. I'll probably get my dad to put some nails in it. Really, the Dollar Tree would probably make a better structure!"
Neutral,"I covers most or all 1911's by most or all manufacturers. My mistake, hoping that it was all going to be about Colt 1911's. picture quality not too good ."
Positive,This is an excellent tripod for Sony Video Camera. I am using this with my Sony Camcorder and remote is working pretty good. Its legs are strong. I am using the same with my Nikon D50( remote is not usable). And I am satisfied with the performance. only one issue is the base where you attach camera is plastic. So sometimes I am not comfortable with my DSLR with its zoom lens
Very Positive,This is an extremely well written thriller that left me in a slight daze by the time I was finished. A great aspect of this book is that the ending is totally unpredictable.
Very Positive,"PUR, now Germany's most popular band, had originally never planned on releasing a live album, but by 1992 their audience's calls for one became too loud to be ignored and PUR Live was recorded during a Germany-wide tour.From older pieces like ""Drachen sollen fliegen"" and ""Fallen"" to the songs that even relatively new PUR fans know by heart (""Lena"" or ""Ohne Dich""), the band exemplifies its talents and hard work by producing stupendous songs live and without the benefit of a high-tech studio.PUR Live became the band's most successful CD only weeks after its release. Now aware of the band and its quality music and lyrics, audiences in Germany and elsewhere have since then turned all of PUR's CDs into record setting ones."
Very Negative,"Of the six glass mugs, I have two left, And am very careful if I use them for any kind of liquid I put in it, be it cold or hot,seams will leak,If the liquid is hot it will split the cup,Do not enjoy a hot coffee bath, As far as I am conserned its a waste of money, but it is your life. not impressed. B.Uzzell Arvada, Colordo"
Positive,"Country of Exiles is a fascinating book, though I'm not sure Leach's arguments add up. He identifies and analyzes certain aspects of our society, but I'm not sure these aspects are central to the rootlessness that is undeniably a central tenet of our modern-day living. Tourism and casinos as the cause of this shiftless life? I don't think so.....but his notes and observations on both of these is informative and fascinating. (I particularly liked his endnotes--half as long as the text, citing every single source; very reassuring.) I want to be critical of this book, but I recognize that there's something there in what he's written. I just finished reading it, and already I want to skim through it again and reread certain passages--which means that this is one book that provokes one into thinking, which can't be all bad."
Very Negative,"Donal Cline clearly demonstrates his inability to distinguish fact from fiction. I find his book to be biased (towards the Murphy-Dolan faction), poorly researched (claiming that Billy the Kid was known as Michael McCarty), and his findings to be very questionable (presents evidence without veryfiable sources.)After reading this book I asked myself why did Cline write this book? He seems to not think to much of ""Billy the Kid"" so why write a book about him? Why not stick to your true passion and write a documentary about James Dolan and L.G. Murphy."
Positive,"Wet Work is one of Buckley's earlier works. I personally prefer his later works, but that is me. I'm still a sucker for anything Buckley writes. At first I thought the dialog was somewhat confusing, but as I read on the characters took over and the story became even funnier.In my opinion the ending was one of his best. Wet Work as a whole wasn't Buckley's best, but it was still worth my time to read it.The slower than usual start was the reason for four stars (4.5, but I'm not rounding)."
Very Negative,The MP3 files downloadable from this site are not for Parsifal but Verdi's Traviata. Amazon needs to fix this urgently.
Very Positive,"It's hard to review a product like this...don't have a can of carbon monoxide to test it with! So, on faith alone, I'm going to say I like it! I bought this particular model because I don't like being tied to the battery makers, and, as opposed to a fire/smoke alarm that you would still want to work even if the power went out, I really don't see the advantage of having a battery backup for a CO monitor...the power goes out and the ability to make CO pretty much goes away, too. Anyway, good (I hope!) product at a good price...I recommend it!"
Positive,"Simple, no batteries to replace, But should have 7 yrs life instead of 5 like the old ones did."
Very Negative,"Got hot and smelled like burning ozone after plugging in. A dissapointing product, never got any real use out of it. Do not recommend."
Positive,"I got six of these. They were painless to install and don't take up the entire outlet plate. Took off a star because I could not stand the time-consuming plastic, sealed packaging they come in."
Negative,"This over-priced pain in ""the sitting area"" has an always-on, glaring RED light.*Red lights are commonly used to warn of an immediate danger that requires attention NOW.*NO-I don't have a carbon Monoxide problem. The red light also stayed on for a week when I plugged it in to an outside plug."
Positive,"Seems to work as advertised. I opted for the non-battery back up, as my heating system has electric blower, so if power goes, heating system does not opearate. Battery/non-battery an individual judgment.Pros: ""ready light"" is not so bright as to be disturbing at night, if it is a visible location, as mine is; simple plug in operation; you can test alarm manually.Cons: its a bit larger than it looks in the pictures, so depending on where you mount it, might be unappealing to actually see the unit installed in a highly visible wall outlet. Instructions indicate not to mount behind curtains, etc. as air flow might be restricted. However, I could not find a ""micro"" unit.Observations: Obviously no safe method to test if the unit actually detects CO.Suggestion: put a pass-through female outlet in the unit, as it uses one plug in the typical wall outlet, and this feature would be helpful in a older home with fewer wall outlets."
Positive,"Very easy to use, just plug in. Currently it hasn't alarmed yet. You can test it if you push the button."
Positive,Tripod is stable. It has strong locking mechanism on the legs. Pan and tilt is very adjustable for smooth movement. Locking mechanism for camera (Sony 403) is easy to connect and engage. Remote control functions and handle are easy to operate and worked with no problems.
Very Negative,"I purchased this item to replace a broken hose. It took the seller over 3 weeks to ship the item, even though the tracing website always showed a different and incorrect shipping date. Upon receipt the product looked nothing like the product on the website. The handle was completely different. In addition, the hose was BLACK and not white as the picture showed. I contacted the seller to replace the item with the proper hose. After several phone calls back and forth, the seller claimed he knew which hose we needed and would ship it that day. I called back 5 days later to find out that the item hadn't even been shipped yet. We requested a refund and got our money back promptly, however it still left us without the hose we needed. So basically, over 5 weeks after ordering the item we still did not have a replacement. What made matters worse, is that we were stuck paying almost $40.00 in return charges, which were not covered by the seller. AVOID THIS SELLER!"
Negative,"If you're looking for porn or something to see, this is NOT it. These are not real fights, but amateur boxing (most of the girls have never boxed before) with 3 rounds each. After the 1st 30 minutes it's a bore."
Negative,"I had several of these as a kid and never had a problem. This one was defective out of the box! When i tried to put the rocket on the pump and lock it in place the air pump nipple snapped off and rendered the toy useless. After further inspection i found that the rocket itself was the cause. The plastic ring at the base that attaches to the pump was deformed and would not mount on the pump properly, when i slid the pump lock over the mount it started to bind and snapped the nipple off.I packaged it up and returned it.I may try some of the other models to see how they stack up."
Very Negative,It's hard to write a full 20 words on a toy that broke on the very first use leaving me with a cheap piece of plastic and a crying five year old.
Positive,My fault that I did not know that this was in tibitian and had subtitles but the content is good and interesting to see in actual clinics and business in Tibet.
Positive,"I ordered the largest size of the sock but my cast is too big for it to completely go over the entire thing. However, it does cover my toes and keeps them warm. Overall, I'm a happy camper with these. If you have a smaller cast, they work perfectly.Pedifix Stretch Socks"
Positive,Comfortable and long lasting. This saved the cost of replacing my current mattress. Worked well on an adjustable bed. Highly recommended.
Neutral,"I had the same experience as reviewer Derek G, only without the attempt to claim the warranty. My Twin size really was wonderful for sleeping, until just about the 5-year mark. Then sleeping hurt because of the me-shaped divot, and only about 4 inches along the sides were still firm. Cheaper and likely much less of a hassle to just give it up as a short-term thing and buy another one, or another brand, to replace it."
Neutral,"I enjoyed the book itself, the writing always captures and maintains my interest. I usually read these books in one or two days. I have been pleased with Xanth books from the beginning and have not missed a volume. The reason that this book only received three stars from me is the cover art. The story depicts Breanna as a very dark skinned young woman. The cover depicts her as a pale faced girl with dirty or hairy arms and legs. A little more consistancy between the artist and the illustrator would appropriate and appreciated.I am amazed to find that what seems like such a minor detail is so incremental in causing this book to lose two stars from my vote.Piers and publishers, you cannot present a wonderfully diverse setting if the marketing on the front tries to appeal to only one group, by making the black character look almost white."
Very Positive,"This book was another wonderful addition to the Xanth series. As with all of the Xanth books, it was a book that I could not stop reading. The book was interesting from beginning to end. To experience yet another adventure with the well known characters was a real treat, and gets better with each book."
Negative,"This is the worst of the Xanth novel, that I have read. I was greatly disappointed in the emphasis on sex. This book seemed to be written for the politically correct, morally lost society member. Piers Anthony did his Xanth fan's a disservce with this novel. Also take note of the cover picture, a small peite ""white girl"" and a zombie, well part of that is in the story. Why was the cover misleading, possibly to sell this trashy novel. Save your money, don't buy this book."
Very Positive,"I got this because I wanted a good quality gray card that wasn't made of paper and would last a while. I don't really need the white or black cards, or the deluxe lanyard (it really is nice quality though), and i basically just threw the card in my bag and left the rest at home. Kind of pricey for a piece of plastic, but if you are in the field shooting in JPG mode and need to do a custom white balance, it's worth it to me, even if it fixes just one shot. The card works great. I've used it several times already and it is a simple but effective way to adjust white balance in strange lighting situations."
Positive,"This does not come with a Thomas and gold Thomas as pictured, but rather with a black wooden Donald engine and matching coal tender car with the number ""9"" on the side. If you look closely you will see on the DVD box pictured that it says ""Donald"" above the pocket that holds the trains so I was expecting this and was not disappointed, however, if you want the trains in the picture you won't get them. That said, the video is a Thomas video and our 2 year old loves it, it contains 7 episodes and a running time of 39 minutes, plus 60 minutes of ""bonus features"" such as 2 sing-along songs, a ""DVD game"" called Sodor Spelling Game and a ""chracter gallery"". I haven't checked these out. Overall a great deal as long as you are expecting a Donald set!"
Very Negative,If you're getting this DVD for the trains like i was don't bother unless you're looking for 2 Thomas trains. You're not going to get Donald like the picture shows.
Neutral,"This runs big, the headband is very cheap and not what appears in the picture, but it works and your little girl won't know the difference. The boots will also be very long and go up to their thighs unless you have a very tall 5 or 6 year old. The dress is also big however with the tie belt that comes with it you can pin up the dress. I think I would have gone down a size if I had to do it again.Overall, my girl loves it and she is very happy with it."
Very Negative,"I don't know if i got a faulty binder,or its just bad quality because it's a big binder, but the moment i opened it and put some paper in, and then closed it, I noticed that the ring was broken, it wont shut all the way tightly and so EVERY SINGLE TIME that I try to take anything out or move papers it opens and its just a big mess. I had to get a new one because i couldn't even use it, and it's frustrating because im in school and NEED a binder that will just WORK !"
Negative,"I've been studying South Asia so I thought I'd watch some movies by people in the region. The movies arrived quickly but the sound quality is terrible and the DVDs themselves skip and get stuck on my computer, my parents' DVD player, and every other DVD player you put them on. The movies themselves have great storylines and music, but the DVDs are really poor quality."
Very Negative,I can not be certain but I don't think the other reviewers and I saw the same movie. Acting was terrible video was terrible plot was terrible. Good try I guess.
Very Negative,"Let's keep this simple: promising plot ruined by -Bad acting.Poor and often ignorant dialogue (scripting).Inconsistent plot elements (slow walking zombies, then fast ones, then back to slow).An inhabited island overrun by zombies, yet not a SINGLE boat was available anywhere.Piss poor directing.What else is there left to say?"
Negative,"Nice, item for the price, but not good for shower curtain use; not enough tension force. Best for light curtains in small windows."
Neutral,"With a very narrow, fiberglass shower, it's been difficult finding a tension rod for the curtain. This one installed easily but it doesn't stay up as well as I'd like. I resolved that by using a small square of ""Gripliner"" under each end which seems to be working well. That may not be as attractive as I would want but it does the job."
Very Negative,"This item does not look like the photo. It is very thin (.5"" or so) and the round decorative end part is very small (about 1.5"" diameter). There is a piece of white plastic that shows at the end of the rod that is not in the photo. It does not look well made- I would have preferred one of the plain white ones that you can buy anywhere- they look heavy duty next to this one. I have had an Amazon account for 10 years or so, and I have never before returned an item. This will be my first time."
Negative,"Baking With Julia is an AMAZING Book.It is an exceptionally well written resource that is an accurate reflection of the PBS televised series of same name.When I stumbled onto the option to order a DVD [suposedly of the full series] on the book's writter, Dorie Greenspan I ordered it immediately!!Well, the DVD arrived today and it is only a minute fraction [i.e., only 8 shows from this far more extensive series] selection of the books recipes. What a misleading dissapointment - as I expected when I place the order for this dvd that it reflected the full series ... nothing in the product description indicated otherewise.Would I still purchase it if I knew up front that it was not the full series ... probably yes ... because I love Julia as well as the series and the book.However, the nature of this post is ""Buyer beware"""
Positive,"This ""Baking with Julia"" Dvd is delightful as are all of Julia's programs. Seeing her interact with expert Bakers is very entertaining and informative. My only complaint is that it is not the entire Series and therefore is not nearly a true companion to the Cookbook ""Baking with Julia"" from the same series. There are only 8 of the 24 episodes included. Each one is masterfully filmed, crisp and clear and the food photos are luscious and mouthwatering as the finished products are presented. The ""Baking with Julia 2"" Dvd has been released and still only contains 8 more programs. I hope that they will hurry and complete the set- but regret that they didn't just make the entire series available to begin with. It is for that reason only that I give it a 4 rather than 5 star rating."
Very Negative,"The shows (and Julia) are great. 5 stars for them but the disk was defective from the manufacturer and would not play segment 2 (Decorative Loaves). First disk would freeze up and shut down the entire disk (as if stop button were pressed). Exchanged it and had the same problem with the second one. These shows deserve a much better presentation than this manufacturer was willing to give it. Great show, but lousy DVD mastering job."
Very Positive,"Bryan Wilson's solo album is just in words I can't explain but breathtaking. He is truly anointed by God. If this brotha keeps doing albums like this, he is going to tear the scene in gospel music."
Positive,"Hard to rate a book. But the Amazon service was excellent. I obviously wish I did not need to order it. I have not read it yet, but an initial browse showed it will probably help a lot if I get serious about it. Price was hard to beat, and its condition was like new. I could not tell it was a used book."
Very Positive,"I regard Dr. Bernstein as the top authority for Diabetes. This book will give a diabetic all the information required to completely understand his/her condition. I do not have the discipline to follow his recommended diet...however, with the understanding of Carbs, I can with diligence control blood sugars. I give more credence to the Glycemic Index than Dr. Bernstein...seems to work for me. I do not hesitate to recommend this book to all diabetics and partners of diabetics!"
Very Positive,Excellent book...well worth reading by anyone battling diabetes either type and by anyone concerned for someone who is in that situation.I have battled diabetes for over 7 years now and am fairly well read but Dr Bernstein has taught me fresh ways to battle the situation.Delighted with the speedy service.RegardsRoy N.
Positive,"I think a couple of people are missing the point... The reason this is out is (I heard) they didn't have the cash to finish AV Vol 2, so this would generate some cash AND be of interest to their core fans. Plus, the demos ~are~ a good insight to their creative process.... I ~love~ to see the rough drafts... If you're just waiting for Vol 2, why did you buy this in the first place?"
Positive,"First thing's first, ""Homespun"" is an album of demos for ""Apple Venus"". If you don't have that record, look there first (although if you're new to XTC, ""Skylarking"" is the usual recommendation).So a collection of demos, what to expect? Essentially it's a track-by-track match for ""Apple Venus"". Sonically, you couldn't tell it's so much a set of demos except in a couple places (""Frivolous Tonight"") because it sounds so complete, in fact to the point where some pieces sound virtually identical to their final takes-- even in places you wouldn't expect it like orchestral workouts ""River of Orchids"" and ""Green Man"".Is it interesting? Yeah, extremely, and in a lot of places it can be as good or better than the original (""Knights in Shining Karma""), but truth to be told, unless you're a diehard, you probably don't need to hear the work versions of this material. More casual fans definitely want to check out ""Apple Venus"", it's a fine record."
Positive,"These lovely glass mugs comfortably hold approx. 12 ozs. I contacted manuafacturer inquiring why the mugs were advertised as 16 oz capacity when they hold only 12 and was advised they measure all the way to the brim. Yep, I tried it and the mug will hold that amount but you won't be able to pick it up without spilling it!I'm keeping them as they are easy to keep clean."
Very Negative,"I contacted Anchor Hocking and they said that they do not recommend liquids over 160 F degrees to be placed in these mugs. Other reviews seem to imply that people do put boiling liquids in the mugs, but the company does not seem to sanction this use.I have had glass mugs crack on me before because I was not as careful as I should have been in reading the advertised claims, so I am now very carefull. I passed on this product, although they certainly do look beautiful."
Very Positive,"For beginners like us, this is a wonderful video. It is visually appealing. The instruction is paced just right and clear in all respects."
Very Negative,"This video is fine for ballroom dancers, but it has nothing to do with the authentic Argentine Tango. Even ballroom dancing has now a separate category for Argentine Tango. Unfortunately, this video is not that. That's why, I rate it at 1."
Very Positive,"I've only been a Texas Rangers fan since 1994, and my wife gave me this book as a present in 1997. I knew the Texas Rangers existed before I came to live in the Dallas/Ft. Worth Texas area, but I never thought much of them. I didn't realize the characters and history of the team. If you're a casual Rangers fan, or a die hard Rangers fan, then you should have this book. It's filled with all kinds of informational pieces about the team's history, going back to the early 70's when they were the Washington Senators. Focuses heavily on the 1996 season in which they finally made it to the playoffs after about 25 years."
Very Positive,"This is a great book, fun and full of significance. I can still see the main character riding his bike ""Bice"" and feel his loneliness. Very ironic the way in which the author describe everyday life: you will love it!"
Negative,"I love Little Critter books, but this one isn't as good as most. It is cute, and my kids like it fine, but others are better. I think my favorite are the ones titled ""Just Me and...."""
Very Negative,"I tried this software as an alternative to ULead's DVD PictureShow. The good news: DVD Photoplay makes it easier to load pictures into a slide show project than ULead's software.The bad news: THE SOFTWARE DOESN'T WORK. I've tested the program on three computers: An IBM Laptop with a HP USB CD Writer, a Dell desktop with an internal CD Writer, and a Sony VAIO desktop with an internal CD Writer. Whenever I tried to write the project to CD, the software failed to recognize my CD Writer on each machine.I emailed customer support, and though I was assured I would receive an answer within 3 days, 10 days later I still haven't heard from them.I wish I had kept my receipt so that I could get my money back for this worthless software..."
Positive,I like the video quality. the story and the performances are great! The special effects are amazing. I am happy to this as part of my collection.
Positive,"This set was great - as soon as I got it I called people over and watched Spiderman 3. It's a little hokey, yes, but it looked so good that no one even cared. The picture is spectacular, the sound is great, and the price wasn't bad at all (around $60). I'd definately recommend this to anyone interested in getting the movies. I'll never buy another regular DVD again! Upconverting is for chumps - get BluRay and never look back!"
Negative,why am I being asked to review a product I didn't purchase. Need to fix the system or allow me to delete the request.
Positive,"I ordered these for my son, he loves them! He watches them all the time and takes them everywhere he goes. They were such a good price and the shipping was reasonable and fast."
Very Positive,"They were good.Early Miami Club Sound. Later to be imitated by others. Listening to their music makes me want to be back and re-live my youth,my club scene days. Saw them perform live.Before the Beach as we called it became ""South Beach"".If you want fun dance music then find this cd.If you were around at that time it will bring back memories."
Very Positive,Excellent method for transfering your videos to your computer for editing and making CD's. The i.Link cable is easy to use. Make sure you order the right cable. I ordered the wrong cable a 4 pin to 4 pin which I believe only works if you have a Sony computer. Most other computers like my Dell will probally need the 6 pin to 4 pin cable.Also make sure your computer has the capability before ordering. i.LINK is also known as Firewire and IEEE-1394.It does provide excellent high speed quality video transfers.
Very Positive,"Very good driving game, good graphics and physics, although FlatOut2 is of course better. I only got this cause I went thru all of flatout2 and needed more! Only complaint: too much ""dirt"" driving, I prefer cities and concrete. Also, it seems a bit harder than FlatOut2, but I am getting thru it in time."
Negative,"If you believe people have an eternal soul, this book is not for you. If you believe death is the end physically and spiritually, and you want your child to believe that, maybe you will like this book. I found it not comforting at all, and not what I want my child to believe."
Positive,"This book simply explains the process of living and dying, by giving examples of the lifecycle of certain animals and how they eventually die. It could have had alittle more emotion, because there is always emotion connected to losing a loved one. Even children feel that emotion or loss."
Very Positive,"Excellent picture book that explains the lifetimes of animals, plants, and people. It talks about the usual lifetime, but also explains that some lifetimes are shorter due to certain curcumstances. Esp. good resource to share in the circumstance of a younger person's death."
Very Positive,This book was of a great help explaining the death of our children's papa. All creatures/things have a life cycle. The illustrations were beautiful. Easily explainable to children.
Very Positive,Well written has a lot of tips and information on the how to fish in ponds and lakes with flies
Positive,"I love the look of these, and they've been a great value--about seven years ago I bought four of all 4 sizes, and only two are gone (my grandchildren love the oversized ones)! In 40 years, I never found glasses that went with everything, and survived, so I'm stocking up with this large set of my favorite sizes. Thank you, Amazon.com!"
Negative,This series of DVDs offers some fine performances along with a great deal of annoyance. The top menu offers no access points to most of the listed repertory. Tried on several different machines the problem is persistant. At least the price is reasonable if you don't mind fast forwarding through all tracks to get to the later pieces.
Negative,"This cd is horrible!!! I thought that it might sound a little like there first, but it just sounded weird. It was so bad that when i put it in my cd player, i started bleeding from my ears. Skip this cd for gods sake and by something better like a rake or a loaf of bread."
Neutral,I went to buy the CD yesterday and was told that it was sent back because one of the songs had a problem with it. So a fixed version should be coming soon.
Negative,Very basic . More challenging and rewarding exercises not covered . Many routines designed to be done with a partner than alone
Very Negative,wow this book is very misleading if your a layperson do your research. You will see this textbook everywhere but if you go to were the evidence is this argument completely falls apart are founding fathers printed the first English bible lol but yet these guys say there atheist and agnostic this is funny this book is not documenting a single thing.
Positive,"This is the worst book in the Night World series. Gillian is LJ Smith's worst heroine[Mary Lynette is the best] Gillian is superficial, all she thinks about is being the most popular girl at school and getting David. David is the worst Night World hero[Thierry is the best]. He is stupid[he cheated on the SATs].If you haven't read any of the Night World books, don't start with this one."
Very Negative,"Totally hated this book. Now, don't get me wrong, I love LJS and most of her books. Actually, all of her books except this one. Totally borring and predictable."
Very Positive,"After having seen this in a bookstore, and having seen Michael Stipe's name on the cover, I decided to pickk it up and boy was I surprised: it really is worth picking up.....it's different and very emotional. At times I found myself inspired to write my own (not much luck, though). A full five-star book!"
Negative,"I am the author of an article for ""The Skeptical Inquirer"" about the origins of ""The Mothman Prophecies."" The article, which appeared in the May/June 2002 issue, also may be read at the CSICOP web site.There, I describe the highly dubious role Gray Barker played in the background during the events surrounding this now-well-known West Virginia case. Barker was responsible for at least one telephone call (and possibly more) to John A. Keel and others in an attempt to generate interest in the Mothman and UFO accounts that were rampant at the time.Those who wonder what to believe about ""The Mothman Prophecies"" will gain greater insight into the situation by reading this article -- but only if they truly wish to understand that there is indeed ""more to the story."""
Neutral,"If you've seen the movie, don't expect the book to be anything like it!(Which is not a new concept by far!) Although an interesting read, it's as strange as the Mothman himself, with eveything else supernatural in between! It leaves you asking yourself ""What in the hell just happened?"""
Very Negative,"It is understandable why his other books, according to his own admission, were not well received.Mr. Keel offers some rather off the wall explanations with little or nothing in the way of proof except HIS word. For those unfamiliar with this subject, controversial as it is, the book may have some interest even if of very little value.Mr. Keel dismisses, with a wave of his hand, everything written by valid and serious investigations. Admittedly there are those who have written who do not deserve to be taken seriously and Mr. Keel is at the top of that list.Desmond"
Neutral,"One reviewer of this book berated those who gave it high reviews with the usual ad hominem attacks created by the quasi-literate. Can you take this work at face value? To some degree, yes. Does the ""Mothman"" really exist? I think before you answer that question some homework assignments need to be completed. There's a revolution in the understanding of paranormal events, ufology, cryptozoology, and the like. Amazingly, most of the subject matter I've read on these topics throughout my lifetime CAN be FAR better understood using this POV. I suggest any and all who have interest in these topics start studying: Patrick Harpur's ""Daimonic Reality.."" and George P. Hansen's ""The Trickster and the Paranormal"", both intense as any textbook I encountered in post graduate work, are highly recommended as the first step."
Neutral,"There are plenty of other more detailed reviews about the contents of this book. Let me just say it was entertaining and you have to suspend a lot of disbelief. However, what irritated me the most was ""where the heck were all the photos""? Considering the amount of time Mr. Keel spent in West Virginia/Ohio area watching the skies I can not believe he NEVER took any photos. Granted a lot of time he spent watching and sighting was at night but they had film and cameras back in the early 70's that could handle night photography. There is mention of a an individual trying to do a documentary but the cameras would malfunction or the fim would not develop properly but I found this pretty lame. There are not even any photos of the town, landmarks, roads, witnesses or any physical evidence. I found this the most dissappointing of all. Photos would have made this extremely more credible book."
Neutral,"This book isn't only about Mothman but also UFO, mystery lights, skin burns and such. It's pretty interesting, the retelling of the mysteriuos events, but Keel doesn't sensationize them, which leads to a fairly dry book. You can see why he stands out in his field, he's experienced these things but doesn't over embelish, draw conclusions, or try to start a religion of belief, just says this happened, and this, and that, and so on. So, while I liked the 'hard' facts, it's told in a way that loses interest. Also in the telling, he 'jumps' around a lot, here's one on day 1, here's one on day 20, here's a continuation of day 1 on day 5, etc. It's hard to stay focused on what's happening or what he is trying to do. It's not a bad book, just depends on what you're looking for."
Very Negative,"It was recommended to me by someone whom I think beleives in the interdimensional and non-ET aspect of it all. I kept an open mind, but finally came to the conclusion that John Keel wrote a fradualent and contrived story, with an underlying ""distracted"" attitude that in reality is quite insulting to the reader. The book is probably pure fiction, and if you seek more than fiction, then it is bordering on pure trash. As an ""investigator"" he poorly documents his findings. Don't buy it, check it out from the library, please."
Negative,"I approached this book with a fairly open mind, expecting to read an interesting story about the strange events of 1967. Unfortunately, Mr. Keel's tendency to ramble and a strange, albeit somewhat fascinating, mixture of conspiracy theories, ""ufo"" sightings and Men in Black stories made the book an incoherent mess. The book begins and ends with the events of Point Pleasant, and spends the middle attempting to connect those events with literally hundreds of other experiences throughout the world and throughout history. ..."
Very Negative,"Great, another socially aware electro-dance record. I can't wait for the an Iraqi to come out with one about the current US led invasion."
Neutral,"After the relentless hype building up to the oft-delayed release of M.I.A.'s debut CD, it's finally here, and...well...it's a bit of a letdown, quite honestly, after all the hoopla. Sure, ""Galang"" ""Sunshowers"" and especially ""$10"" are catchy addictive Timbaland-meets-Basement Jaxx on a boat to Jamaica blender, but after a few spins, song after song begins to sound exactly the same, and MIA's signature ""patois"" grates after a bit, too. Strip away the state-of-the-art production beats & sheen from Richard X and Diplo, and you haven't got much - sorta work in progress. I think M.I.A. has lots of potential, but needs to work on her songwriting skills a bit more if she wants to last longer than her cover stories."
Very Negative,"sounds like a third world elementary school class on a field trip to a crack factory. if this music is so revolutionary and worldly, how come the only people listening to it are skinny white boys who wear hats with earflaps indoors?"
Very Negative,"I heard a lot of chatter about this new girl M.I.A. and her album getting a lot of good reviews. I don't know if her phenomenon is a result of her label hyping her in publications or what, but after listening to her album once through, I would advise you to stay away unless ecstasy-rave music is your thing. She is nearly unintelligible on all of her vocals and is drowned out by the incessant reverb present on all most all of her tracks. This is the definition of drivel. I am happy for her and her interesting life story, but her music does not interest me. Save your $!"
Very Negative,"This is quite possibly the absolute worst thing I've ever heard in my entire life. If you're considering buying this CD ,I suggest you go outside, find a construction site, walk up to the guy with the jackhammer, and press your ear to the side of it. If you like how that sounds, then go buy the CD. If not, well.... ""Galang,"" the reggaeton hit, isn't even something to wave a steamy pile of you-know-what at... and the music just goes downhill from there. ""bucky done gun"" (which doesn't even make any sense as a title) is good for use as a humorous conversation starter, but that just about exhausts its usefulness or likeability... much the same as the rest of the CD."
Very Negative,"This album is able to be previewed in full on NME.com If I were you I would go there to find out just what you're about to endure. This album sucks extremely bad. I have not heard anything this half assed in all but two weeks. This garbage getting good reviews is only an indication of the white reviewers out there trying to make this seem cooler than it isn'nt. The beats are exactly the same on every track. Handclaps and half rhythms are only one tenth of the awkwardness on this record. I dont think that anyone with fully functioning ears would like this record, unless they think it makes them look different. For the most part, there is nothing innovative on this record. This is what bad pop music will sound like in ten years. MIA has recorded a travesty ahead of her time. Once again, go to NME.com and preview this before you actully waste your money on this. The sound of this record could have been reproduced with a kettle drum and sticks banging together in a long hall."
Positive,"Say what you will about Arular, M.I.A.'s singularly funky debut album, but one thing you most definitely cannot say is that it's trite, unoriginal cookie-cutter mainstream. You gotta give her props on making a truly original, heartfelt, fun, and invigorating piece of art. Songs like Hombre (w/ Spanish), Bucky Down Gun (w/ Sri Lankan and English slang) are impossible to categorize ...and sometimes hard to understand...but incredibly fun and original, nonetheless. Pull Up the People and Bingo are my fav tracks as they combine M.I.A.'s sultry voice with pulse-pounding beats. Bottom line, if you have an open mind and want something new that's invigorating, singular, and sexy, then this is it."
Neutral,"I've read this book twice, but I admit I've not yet read any of Milan Kundera's other work. Maybe they're amazing. Maybe. But judging from this book--and from some of the other reviewers who have posted here--I'd guess they're about as unpretentious as a pale, young intellecutal discussing the merits of W.G. Sebald and Friedrich Nietsche at a Cambridge, Massachussetts tea shop.This book DEFINES pretentious. The author knows you're an uneducated fool, and he will prove it to you.That said, he's not an idiot, and a lot of his pompousness is justified. If you don't mind having a thousand things quoted at you that you've only read half of, or the author's overall snobby tone, then you really might find some good insights into a the structure of books and the weaving of stories....Or, you might find yourself scribbling death threats to the author in the margins. ...Yeah, that's a bad habit of mine."
Neutral,Saran wrap does not stick to the dishes and it is very inconvenient to store food in fridge. Some of the cups and plates have different shade of color. Brand stamps on the bottom of the dishes are smeared or double-stamped and I do not like that either.Overall they are nice everyday dishes but I do not think they are made with careful quality control.
Negative,"I fell in love with these great dishes but I am dissapointed that they need to be replaced within a few years. They were our wedding set and I wish they didn't look awful. We only use them for family meals and use my husband's everyday Johnson Bros. dishes that are 50 years old! They look great. Too Bad the quality isn't like it used to be... unless we just got a ""bad batch"" although they were purchased from different stores where we registered... Nice to set the table with but will scratch unless your family uses plastic tableware. We don't."
Very Negative,"I was disappointed with the shipping delay of the cooking company. They said they would reimburse the shipping charges but to this date they have not. The product was shipped beyond the date which they said they would ship it, and this was an unusual amount of time."
Very Positive,"I absolutely love this set of dishes. They are dishwasher safe which is a must for me, and microwave safe. The dishes have a nice weight to them, they are not overly heavy or too light. I have been using this set for 8 months now, and I have no complaints at all. I would defiantly recommend this set!"
Neutral,It was very nice and arrived quickly. I bought this as a gift but it wasn't what the recipient wanted. I returned it and ordered the one requested.
Positive,"This book is not all that hard to understand. In simple terms, Laband and McClintock tell us that we waste a lot of money trying to avoid someone else wasting our money. It's not this fact that puts the reader so off guard. The fact that our society spends about four hundred billion dollars trying to influence two trillion dollars in government expenditures (about twenty percent of the total) shows what an inefficient mess our economy has become. This fact of wasted wealth should shock the reader. I couldn't believe it at first. The amount of research used is impressive and definitive. Though Laband and McClintock don't offer any serious solutions to the drain on the economy, this volume helps shape the continuing debate about wealth transfer."
Very Positive,"My wife has some health issues and needs to monitor her temperature regularly. We have gone through all of the cheap digital thermometers we could find, I finally got sick of having the variance in readings(some were off by as much as .5 degrees!) I decided to find the best one I could get. this is it. the same one found in hospitals and doctor's offices, the 690 is accurate, fast and reliable. It also has a history, which makes reporting to your doctor if you need to easy to do. if you only need to take your temp once in a while, don't bother with this, but if you even have to take it weekly, I would say this is the only one to consider. make sure you get extra probe covers and replace the battery regularly but otherwise using the model could not be faster or easier."
Positive,"My husband and I are very happy with our play cabana! We bought it for our 4 month old back in May 2005. We have used it for 2 beach trips. My husband was able to put it together and take it apart easily on the beach (even on windy days). We love the side pockets to put sand bags in to keep it stable on windy days. We just filled plastic bags with sand and placed them in the pockets instead of putting the sand directly into the pockets. With the front being netted and the 2 side ""windows"" being netted she got a great cross breeze. We love that it is SPF 50. We placed her tent under an SPF 50 umbrella for extra sun protection and shade. We love it!!"
Very Negative,iTunes has this exact album available for download on mp3 -- which means you don't have to wait for a CD and you can purchase individual selections. Sad to say that because I sooooo much prefer Amazon. They've been doing a great job in getting our oldies available to us... but need to do more... keep at it! I hope you think so as well.
Very Positive,"As a fan of the German language, I enjoied this CD because it provided a chance to improve language skills while also listening to great music, with a nice, upbeat tempo, and the lyrics do make you think. The songs are of relavant topics, and really do hit home. I loved the CD, and I hope Pur becomes more popular in the States, their music is great."
Positive,"Please note that the format of the Chemical PE exam will change somewhat starting in April 2011. This sample exam is based on the old format that was used until October 2010. The problems are still helpful when practicing for the exam, but this book has no longer the same ""look and feel"" as the new exam. NCEES has a new sample exam book out that matches the new exam specifications and can be ordered from the NCEES website."
Negative,The author's intense focus on the main character's inner thoughts and feelings limits the reader's scope and prevents a broad view of the social environment of the book's setting. It was difficult to sustain an interest in the narrow range of concerns that surface in the exhausting detail flowing from the character's mind.
Neutral,"Kincaid shows that she's a talented author. THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF MY MOTHER is beautifully written. It's not about her mother at all, but about the search for knowledge about this woman that she never met. And thereby a search into herself (well, into the character's self). It's quiet. She even describes ugliness quietly. ""I long to meet the thing greater than I am, the thing to which I can submit."" I was able to sink into it as I read it, but the book didn't stay with me after I was done."
Negative,"I read first edition of this book when it came. There were hardly any books available on SNMP at that time . Rose being one of the creators of SNMP, I expected this book to be good. And I was totally wrong! The descriptions are all fuzzy. After reading it, I had some idea about SNMP but I was not sure of anything I learnt. I think the RFCs on SNMP are best reading. They are precise and they do not leave you feeling uncertain."
Positive,"This saint is my patron, so I could not resist reading her story. This book was well written and kept my interest, as it would for a teenage, or even a younger person. The author did a great job telling the story of this American Saint."
Very Positive,the book was great. i can't wait for the next one. definitely captivating.
Neutral,"I really liked the idea of a modernday Frankenstein book. The plot is very cool and revolves around a number of very interesting characters. But the problem is there are like 92 chapters in this book. That makes each chapter about six pages long. In six pages you can't really be absorbed into the story. Just when something begins to happen that is exciting...BAM you're chapter is over and you are reading about another character. Sometiems chapters even split a single scene into two parts.Bottom line is that the book is good...but I just couldn't really get into it. (But I will be reading book 2, hopefully it will flow a bit better than this one)"
Neutral,"I enjoyed this book and do not think I need to reiterate what the other folks have said in their reviews. I do not think it is as good as some of his others, but nevertheless a good story. I think the series should have been done in one book. This was another ""large print with lots of spaces"" book and I alwys feel a bit cheated when I get one.My complaint with this book is that nowhere is Kevin Anderson's name mentioned by either the author or the publisher. I did not even realize until halfway through the book that he was involved. All I can say is ""Dean, you have enough kudos to share a little with your co-author""."
Negative,"I imagine this is a very creative book written by Dean Koontz, and I loved his Odd books. This book is just too dark for me, too brutal, too mean. I wanted to keep going, but there is no point in forcing my psyche to undergo things that make me too uncomfortable. Although it isn't for me, if you don't mind pretty dark books, you might like it."
Very Positive,Read this when it first came out but didn't have the Kindle edition. Wanted to read again so purchased it. I totally enjoyed reading it again.
Very Positive,"Dean Koontz' three-part take on the Frankestein story is some of the best work he has ever written, very fast paced and addictive this book is impossible to put down. I read the last 250 pages of it in one sitting it was that good.Highly reccomended."
Negative,"I am a big fan of Dean Koontz but not this book. The character Decaulion was boring. I didn't think much of the ending (I don't want to give it away). Usually I'm surprised by the ending, or satisfied. A predictable conclusion."
Very Positive,I bought this book because it was one of the few I hadn't read of Koontz yet. I didn't know what to expect because the Frankenstein idea has become almost a cliche. I was pleasantly surprised. I couldn't put the book down. I immediatelly went out and bought book 2. Now I'm waiting for the third to be written. I strongly recommend this book for any Koontz fan.
Positive,"I have read all the books in this series, and like so many other series (whether book or movie) the first (this one) is definitely the best. This story is very riveting and won't disappoint you. You will want to read the rest of the series, and will be glad you did; but in the end you'll realize that each book after this one gets more unbelievable to the point that the last one is pure fantasy or science fiction."
Negative,"The camcorder was little dirty, and had a missing lens cover...Joanne did not have the missing cover and did not know why it was dirty...The power cord was defective...ordered a new one...Looked like it was chewed into...The case (cassette) compartment was slightly bent and unable to open at first...made some adjustments to it...Fred"
Negative,"I just received my ZR 40 and really liked its size and low weight. But once I tried it, the fun was quickly over. Low light recording (in my apartment with lights on) was horrible and even with low-light mode selected, it was unacceptable. And in night mode, everything moves in slow motion. Overall, the quality was not that great, even in day-time shooting.I have a regular Sony Hi8 cam, and its low light and night capabilities are 100 times better. I would seriously hold out for a better camera, even if it costs a bit more.The image stabilization also makes the picture look strangely un-lifelike."
Very Positive,"Mannnn this boy be wreckin, Big Steve from the Woss Ness, RIP man, why do all the good rappers gotta die man, and all the crappy ones still around puttin out wack albums. Get this fa sho, if you from h-town, u already know, and if u dont, u a busta!"
Very Positive,I love that it sits INSIDE the window casing so my dog can't get to it as easily & it looks really nice.
Positive,Enjoyed this book even though it was time travel with mystical creatures. The story was interesting and I enjoyed the history along with the folklore.
Very Negative,"As a long time Kurt Cobain fan ,Kurt was the reason I learned guitar years ago ,I was always a singer and songwriter since I was young but when Nirvana came out in 1991 I learned guitar as well cause the man inspired me too not just sing but write my own riffs.on this release save the money and buy the whole box set it is worth it, except for Courtney being the Yoko Ono money whore that she is and saving these extra demo tracks for this cd instead of putting every last outake demo live etc on last years boxed set.so you have to buy this cd just for the 3 new tracks.I know Courtney has enough money so I would'nt buy this cd.Kurt should not be remembered this way with his widow milking every dollar she could get.I will make sure if I become famous that only my children would be in control of my music who would treat it with respect."
Neutral,"I liked as a fan, but only to point out who really is a fan. This album contains some tracks from the box with the lights out."
Negative,"Four stars for the music, minus 2 stars for the concept. The review title represents exactly how I feel about this disc. One can't pretend that this disc is anything but a quest for more money, and some will agree with me that this doesn't even represent the box very well at all. This is one of those discs that, if you are a die-hard collector, you would buy, but most collectors already have the box anyway, so that makes you less likely to buy this one. Also, if you weren't a big fan and you bought the disc actually thinking it was the ""best"", it wouldn't give an accurate overview of the box and you'd probably become uninterested. So basically, if you must have the few extras, find it cheap or used, and if you're a first timer, let this be the last thing you add to your collection. It's been said a few times already, but just get the box and make your own comp. Why buy the milk when you can get the whole cow for...a little more?"
Very Negative,"Even though the song list looks impressive, don't waste your money on this one. This is the poorest quality sound I've ever heard on a CD.Being a Nirvana Fan, I have other albums that sound great, but I can't recommend this one.Again don't waste your money."
Very Negative,Nirvana should be ashamed of having this released. If it's the best of the box then the rest of the box must be overdriven drunken slobbering screams accompanied by smashing guitars and kicking drums. If you like unprofessional recordings you will love these. My guess is these were recovered from the trash somewhere to make a quick buck. Although if they are demos it's a wonder Nirvana got anywhere.
Very Negative,"Wow, what a suprise! Almost all the worst songs from the box are right here on one CD! In addition to all the smash hits on the CD are three previously unreleased tunes soon to shoot up six notches to number one on Kasey's Top Forty this Sunday. A comparative failure to the upcoming Ozzfest 10-Year anniversary DVD. One star for Blandest."
Very Negative,"I must admit, it was terrible. I hate to admit i liked it. I guess it was so STUPID, you couldn't help it."
Negative,"Not knowing Wind River the guide really did very little to help plan a trip excpet for forming a general idea of where to go and what to see and climb. On this level it fulfilled it's job, but I was hoping for much more."
Positive,"I just got this yesterday. I have crystal glassware, and the easy way for me to see if something is crystal or not is by simply tapping the glass.Well, when I tapped them, it sure didn't sound like crystal, rather it sounded exactly like glass. And I can't find the word ""crystal"" on the box anywhere. I was rather disappointed, but then again, what do you expect..."
Negative,"This collection of sentences and catch phrases is VERY weak on technical details and VERY heavy on the diatribe. In several instances, it is down right incorrect when referencing history. This book may fit the needs of a poli. sci. type, but it is less than a dust collector when it comes to those working in the fields of IT/IW/IA. As a 2 decade professional in the field, take my recommendation and avoid this book if you are looking for anything beyond recycled political phrases related to IW."
Very Negative,"IT IS NOT WHAT I THOUGHT IT WASIT DOSE FIT THE CAMRA BUT I THOUGHT THAT IT HAD A USB END ALSO , SO THAT I COULD HOOK TO MY COMPUTER"
Negative,Buying a Sony cable wasn't worth it. I could have spent less buying any 4pin to 4pin 1394 firewire cable. Search around. Buying name brand may not be worth it.
Negative,I ordered the Sony 4Pin to 4Pin Digital Video cable for my Sony digital camcorder and it came with a bent pin in one of the connectors. I specifically ordered the Sony rather than a generic one because I thought it would be more likely to be of higher quality. It was advertised as new. When I plugged it into my camcorder it did not work. On examining it I found that it had a bent pin. When I looked at the camcorder connection I found that the bent pen had ruined the connection in the camcorder. What a bummer. I contacted the seller and they were willing to send me a replacement for the cable but took no responsibility for the defective one ruining the camcorder connection. I did not bother to get another one for obvious reasons.
Positive,I was trying to resolve a technical issue with a TRV-950 Sony Handy Cam but the cable I received seemed to work between cameras but didn't solve the issue with capturing to Sony Vegas Pro 8. There is something I can't figure out with the 950 so I have been using my TRV-900 and Ulead to capture video then importing that into Vegas for editing. If someone reads this and knows how to get a TRV-950 to capture to Vegas Pro 8 directly please let me know.
Very Positive,This books explains in simple language God's gifts to us and His amazing love. An easy read with huge concepts.May it be a blessing to you as well.
Neutral,"I bought an R-rated copy and didnt think there was going be a difference. Well, the gore is cut out of this picture. There is little here and there, but the unrated version is so much better. Its an alight movie without the gore, one of the funniest pictures ive seen in a long time."
Very Positive,"Toxie at his best this is one of the greastest TROMA movies ever made I would gladly pay 30 dollars for a movie this good also get the Tox Box***** and the Toxic Crusaders***** It's the cartoon show from when I was kid It's FRESH as HELL. The extra features are great like always with TROMA, you also get a cool Citizen Toxie poster!"
Neutral,This movie was bought for my husband and he said that it was interesting. He had heard of the movie and wanted to view it for himself.
Very Negative,"I have been taking two capsules daily for two months and not felt or seen one difference in my health. This hasn't been the miracle pill to help cure my PCOS or help my ovulate. In fact, I had a period before I started this pill and not one since."
Very Positive,"I bought these to compliment my basic cherry red 4 piece set. Although it came with cereal bowls, I wanted something casual to serve pasta or stew but did not want the huge pasta bowls. These are the perfect size and the color is a perfect match."
Very Negative,"I didn't like this version of the song, ""when you believe,"" even though it was the original. I favored the orchestral rendition of this song which was beautifully arranged by Hans Zimmer."
Negative,"Here are two songbirds who are trying to be the best singers of all time. I hate this diva routine! I admit they do have maybe one catchy tune.But,this song is so irritating.Two divas trying to hit the highest notes in one song!I give Whitney one star for her almost Josephine Baker look at the Oscars,you looked fine! And her Children song from the 80's. And Mariah for her badly premeditated sexy image and her undying effort to be the best,major ego! Two divas who should SHUT UP!"
Very Positive,I thought it was an amazing very well put together book. I really enjoyed it the whole way through not one problem
Negative,"""The Magic Barrel"" was a collection of stories that intrigued me, if only for the whimsical sounding name. I was disappointed, however, to find that the stories themselves were themselves not whimsical in the least. Malamud has created a world where paranoia is abundant, and worse, where poor, lackadaisical decisions are abound equally. There are no winners in any of Malamuds stories. I found myself becoming angry at the characters, for the way in which they responded to conflicts was alarmingly pathetic. His character development is strong, however, and I did enjoy maybe one or two of the stories until I found the ending rather dreary. If a literary work is ""sad,"" that is not a deterrant for me. Malamud's characters, on the other hand, are hopeless. I can't seem to enjoy reading about people who operate in such ways."
Very Negative,I selected the complete short stories of Malamud and this book is only a selction of short stories. I was disappointed but we decided to keep it and be more careful in ordering.
Neutral,"The Small-circle of Wally Jay is a very basic book about Ju-Jitsu. As a Ju Jitsu sensei myself, I want to catalogue this book as a program for 6 to 3rd Kyu (white -yellow and orange belt)."
Negative,There is only 2-3 great trackes on this. Such a shame that most of these compilations only ever have a few great inspiring tracks while the rest are just pure background stuff.
Positive,"I really enjoyed this book. If you like novels that are vivid and descriptive, that clearly paint life of women in other countries and cultures, then this book is for you. It offers a glimpse of two very different families in El Salvador - rich coffee plantation land owners and peasant coffee pickers/servants. I specifically liked how Benitez had the action and every day life ~ with joy, sorrow, love, births, deaths ~ take place in the context of major historical events. I loved how the ""telenovela"" and its characters took on a life of their own. Anyone who has visited a Latin American country can vouch that they can really take a whole nation by storm! (Just think, how many people in America were waiting to see which David won American Idol?!) As a person of Salvadoran descent it served as middle-age introduction to the tumultuos and rich history of the country and it left me longing to learn more and reconnect with my roots."
Very Positive,I wish I had more time to write a review worthy of this book! I will say that this book is fulfilling and rich read. The stories of the women and their families in this book provide insight into the contrast of the social classes in El Salvador in times past. The very personal stories allow the reader to connect with the characters while learning a great deal about the history of El Salvador from the 1930's on.
Neutral,I rented this movie on Amazon Instant Video. I've seen the movie before and was watching it to satisfy a Bollywood craving.The movie itself is about a family with three sons and a daughter. The first two hours are really happy and full of songs and dancing. The last hour is the family drama hour.Giving this three stars because the quality of the video is pretty bad. The image was not clear and the audio sounded a little muffled at times.There were no subtitles for most of the songs.
Very Positive,"Ambrose Bierce's collected stories, mostly of the Civil War but also of peacetime America in the last half of the 19th Century, are amazing not least because of the fact that he was one of the first to write in this genre. No doubt much of his inspiration for his Civil War stories were based upon his own observations as an officer in the Union Army while other stories may have been ones he came up with while living on the Pacific coast.Ghostly occurances, strange machines, unexplained episodes, monsters... Bierce seems to have lived in a strange world of shadows all his own. It is somehow fitting that Bierce simply disappeared in the early 20th Century.Great book. Definitely a classic."
Positive,"This little paperback (31 pages) was published in 1993, just before Chavez passed away at the age of 66. It is probably considered out of date.But it has some great photographs of Chavez all through his life. It has a short, concise biography.What did I learn? Chavez's grandfather immigrated from Mexico and fathered 14 children. Cesar's father was the last one to leave the family home and married rather late, at the age of 38.Cesar did not like school, nor did he like the English language.He fasted three times for over three weeks each. This must have been tough and may have indelibly harmed his health.So, this book of course was published before Chavez's birthday became a state holiday in California. And we hardly hear anything anymore about the United Farm Workers. That's an area for some young person to follow up. Diximus."
Very Negative,"This book is so obscene in some parts, and its not even written by Naomi Campbell, but some filthy man. Dont pick up this book if you want your brain to be burnt away by the promiscious literary flop of some freak."
Very Positive,"Timeless story of a woman and her struggle to care for those she loved. Fighting against the male dominated society of her time, Tess sacrifices her own interests to provide for her family and attempt to stay true to the man she loves. Hardy does a wonderful job of painting the landscape and using it to enhance Tess's physical struggles. His portrait of Tess as a strong woman is balanced with her vulnerability, pure heart and hope for a better future.Norton's version includes insight into Hardy's background and the writing of Tess of the D'Urbervilles. Very helpful towards understanding the dynamics of the story."
Very Positive,"There is many ways to look at this book and how it corolates to his Hardy's life but the point is I think he wanted to make this a beautiful work of art. And it is. Many girls who went through tough times in life can relate to this like I have. It might not be dramatic as this book but I have been in many situations that were unbelievable and ""soap opera - ish"" and I have seen all sorts of people and I do not misjudge people because everyone at one point in their lives do things out to character. This book is good and I can't say well written but it is a good piece of art."
Negative,"I'm a fan of classics, but I could not force myself to struggle through this book. I could neither identify with the characters (Tess especially seemed extraordinarily weak-willed and passive) nor follow through the endless description of the novel. Iw ould suggest a different book"
Positive,"I rapidly read this book in high school for a test the next day. I knew that I wanted to read it again because it was so good and I was missing the subleties. I loved it. The theme is that our lives are goverened by what we think of ourselves. Poor Tess was so wrong, but for the times understandable. Hardy writes without including the graphic details, but the story remains. A story that is suspended in time."
Negative,"I am sorry to all of you who like this book but I would never wish a single soul to read this. This book has the plot: a girl goes to a farm, falls in love and everything goes wrong. The book just goes on and on. The only reason I read it was because my mother asked me to. This book could have been written in 50 pages but no. It goes on for 300 some odd pages. I would have rather read the dictionary. The only reason I give this book 2 stars is because there was maybe four parts that consisted of 2 pages that were mildly interesting. Take my word for it. This book should be skipped."
Negative,"I thought this book was long, drawn out, and boring. It was too descriptive. To me, the writing style is a lot like Jane Eyre. I don't particularly like that type of book.Plus, it was way too sad and unrealistic. I don't think THAT many bad things could happen to one person."
Very Negative,"We had to read it for our GCSE coursework. Everybody found it boring and too descriptive. If you have a choice, do not choose this book! To make it worse, it is incredibly long and depressing. DO NOT EVEN TOUCH IT!!!"
Neutral,"I love the book but the size is very unwieldy. It is the size of a coloring book, very heavy. The print is small and difficult to read. Of course the book itself is a wonderful classic if you love Thomas Hardy like I do."
Very Negative,"I recommend this book as kindling for a fire. It is the worst book that could have possibly been written. If you want to read this, jump off the nearest bridge or very tall building (without a parachute). That's probably the most similar experience to reading this book. Thank you, and have a good day."
Neutral,"i Do like this book. I red it for school for 10th grade. But it was pritty hard for me to read, because Im not a English person. I admit that I used cliff's notes alot, but i did reed some. I agree with the person that wrote you should see Titantic before reading this book. Titanic is the pick for intelagent people, and you don't have to think much!! But I do like 'Tess.' It's a very sad book, but I do not like Angel Clare. I think he's a wimp--Why can't he be like Jack Dawson and save Tess (Rose)? Tess of the Dubervilles is a very tough, but good book."
Negative,"I wanted to know whether my affiliate link, and commission link worked.It didn't!The book is written in period language, hence I am still in the introductory phase.It is in very small type, which further delays progress."
Positive,Reading it for the second time. Read it for the first time in high school. This is a good read and a good story.
Very Positive,"Hi, Today we went to toysrus and picked up this puppy surprise. And we LOVE it!When we opend it up every one was excited to see how many puppys it would have. (including Mom!) And we got 2 girls and 1 boy :) Of all the reviews I read everybody said they got 3 or 4 puppys, I never herd of someone getting 2. Well Im going to go play with my puppys, bye :)- Jackie"
Very Negative,I bought this product and would NOT recommend it to anyone. The rubber tubs are sticky and you need to wear gloves and it leaves marks on your bikes. The red rubber protecter fell off the first time it was used. The lock that was recommedned to go with it does not fit. When the tubes are locked in place you need a hammer to get them to release. The tire holder rails will not lock in place even with a pliers. I used the product as instructed in the manual and my bike fell off in the middle of an intersection! If you use this product than you need to bungi your bike in three places to secure it! Do Not just use the hooks!
Positive,"Works as advertised. Arrived promptly. Is pretty heavy and more difficult to assemble and install than anticipated, but overall the best product I have seen for mounting 4 bikes with curved top tubes onto the back of a hitch. The manufacturer should increase the spacing between the center 2 bikes. I may have a welder do this modification. Drove 6 hours carrying 2 bikes and they didn't budge and were not scratched up by the travel."
Very Positive,"Wow! ...finally something new and creative for the dance floors this year. Got a promo of this album about a week ago and havn't stopped listening to it since. All of Mynt's hits in one place plus their new single ""Still Not Sorry"" which I think is really going to be a huge smash for them. Lot's of cool 80's production and fat synths on this one and I'd say it's definitely a worth while buy if u are into dance music/electrohouse 80's style./DJ Eric"
Very Positive,Naader has taken his class directly to video - this is a wonderful opportunity to experience his caring and warm direction for beginning to intermediate students of hatha yoga. The next best thing to being there.
Neutral,"I was looking for smaller width collars/nipples so you could actually USE the ""ready to feed"" bottles as they were intended, and actually found these disposable nipples second. I discovered that the spare bottle parts for my 'pump and feed' Medela bottles are actually the exact same size as these nipples!!!!! So to save the Planet some more trash, look in Amazon.com for ""MEDELA SPARE BOTTLE PARTS"". The kit you find has three nipples/collars/caps per $11 box. They work perfect and are reusable over the long term! Check it out!!!! If you need them for travel, a water rinse and a good wipe down with a pacifier wipe will work great in a pinch if you cant get to a kitchen/microwave before you run out. Happy feeding, and hope this helps!Medela Breastmilk Bottle Spare PartsThe First Years Pacifier WipesMedela Quick Clean Micro-Steam Bags"
Negative,"The Logitech Wilife outdoor cameras have a known defect (caps melting).[...]They fail in about a year. This is due to the following four 1000uF caps: C26 C27 C31 C32. The initial was a10v cap then later releases were 16v. I replaced them with 25v. See Digikey part number UHE1E102MHD6. The caps are from Nichicon and are Aluminum Electrolytic. They are rated for 10,000 hours at 105 degrees C. The caps don't fit perfectly (the original are 8mm diameter versus 12.5mm that I put in) so insulate the leads and let them float above the circuit board.DLC-810e, CLC-110e, DLC810e, CLC110e, Lukwerks Outdoor Camera, 961-00290, Wilife Outdoor Camera, Logitech Outdoor Camera"
Positive,"The author's style is captivating and simple. He was in Japan over twenty years ago, so I'm assuming that some if not much of his anecdotes may be regarded as dated over there. Regardless, a fun read which doesn't follow the stereotypical 'Japanese kids don't have fun' or 'Japanese people don't have individuality'."
Very Negative,"""I came to Japan at the invitation of the Japanese Ministry of Education . . ."" indeed! Feiler has a very high opinion of himself. And isn't it a bit inappropriate for a teacher to kiss the hand of a junior high girl, let alone a junior high girl of another culture? I've been reading a lot of Japanese non-fiction and travel essays since a recent visit to Japan and so far this book ranks low in terms of enjoyment, educational value and insight because of its pretentious tone."
Neutral,There is no reason for this movie to be as long as it is. The length dilutes endlessly dilutes the story.At 2 hours it would have been a fine movie.
Negative,"This is already my favorite movie for at least ten years, from the first time I saw it. It is a movie about an unsettled men who lives life lightly, but is also in love. Slowly he is adapting to a life with only one woman, the one he loves. The very romantic and chalenging movie is set in Chechie around 1965 somewhere."
Neutral,"Most of the time Phil Kaufman and me get along pretty good, and this time is no different. However, I really didn't get as involved in this one as I did The Wanderers, The Right Stuff, or Quills. Some provacative camera work a plus, though overall I thought it could have been better."
Neutral,"read the book. trust me read the book. ( unless all want to see are the naked in this movie) just go get the book, beats the movie by 10 stars"
Negative,"The Unbearable Lightness of Being was considered an unfilmable novel for a good reason: the point of Kundera's writing is not his plot - or even his characters - but his style. For instances, his endless digressions about history, politics, and philosophy. For the movie, we are left with nothing but plot and character. OK, what is one to do? That in itself wouldn't be so bad if I didn't watch the film with the constant thought: I could read the book in less time than it takes me to watch this movie. This is a SLOW film. It takes an hour-and-a-half story and takes three hours to tell it. I can't recommend the film."
Very Positive,"I have reviewed this book previously but am having a second bite because I am annoyed by the conduct of the previous reviewer. He claims, apparently trying to dam the dialogue, there is a phrase: ""As you known, Raargh Sergeant, we Wunderkzin ..."" No such phrase occurs in the book. A human says to a Kzin born on Wunderland ""We sometimes call you Wunderkzin ..."" I suggest that if the reviewer wishes to pick holes in the style of a particular story he quote the actual words he complains of and not something he has invented. I believe this is related to a thing called ethics, you know, like honesty and truthfulness.And all thes stories in the book are teriffic! Scream and Leap!"
Very Negative,The drive lasted 3 days before the flash fell off and was lost from the encasement. The encasement was examined and appeared to be flimsy plastic. I don't recommend this product based on a lost unit.
Positive,"Only a slight hitch because it didnt quite fit in a Levitron opening. But, with a bit of filing, we cured that.Now she can set the knob and leave the bathroom. Saves a/c costs of forgetting the fan is running. A fine solution to an unmentionable problem."
Very Negative,"Fait sur commande et ennuyant a mourir, cette album est tout a fait parfait pour s'endormir...nul!"
Very Negative,"This book is terrible. The writing is terrible, the art is terrible (obviously terrible, too: one of the dragons' heads was obviously photoshopped onto another dragon's body on another page), the story is boring, it's just... bad. It's anti climatic, and throughout the story it's just hardship after hardship of them attempting to kill dragons. I found it hard to finish just skimming it."
Neutral,"I've purchased many aftermarket mufflers claiming OE type construction and sound quality, none of them have lived up to their claims. The last muffler of this type I bought leaked from every seam and got loose baffles in only a few months. If you actually want OE sound quality, especially on a truck, then get an OE muffler, even though it will be expensive. I'm hoping this will at least last longer than the last one did. This one claims to be stainless steel, but doesn't really look like it."
Negative,"I can't understand how Manhattan Transfer gets all those studio musicians to play on their albums. I mean, it just makes their singing sound worse against the best drumming (Steve Gadd), bass playing and sax playing in the world. The two stars are for Kafka and the studio musicians only."
Negative,"Don't get me wrong, this is a totally enjoyable listen, but is it just me or is every single song on the disc the same. Hell, they're even the same as on Cold & Bouncy, Hawaii and Gideon Gaye. The one thing that makes this album different is John McEntire's wonderful production and the 'Lab girls. If you dont own any High Llamas disc, start here... but if you already do, dont expect anything new."
Very Positive,"My favorite track is the first one, ""Bach Ze"". ""Harpers Romo"" sounds like it should have been on the Beach Boys' ""Pet Sounds"" album, ""Triads"" reminds me so much of ""Hawaii"", and ""Go To Montecito"" sounds decidely like a Steely Dan tune. Laetitia and Mary are nice additions ..."
Positive,"This book did give the reader some very interesting facts and folk lore about archaeological discoveries that could prove the existence of superior ""giant"" races in the Americas. The only thing I did not like about the book (except for the grammatical errors), was that the author would mention some dramatic event (such as the discovery of giants' bones in a mound) and leave the reader hanging after a couple of paragraphs about the find. This book could have easily been an entire set of volumes, should everything have been explained in detail. Overall, it was a very interesting book leaving the reader wanting to know more about certain discoveries and theories within the book."
Neutral,"wish that he would show more in the field and less in the classroom,,and stay with the book, which is top level in my book...james.........."
Very Positive,"I loved the book. From the places I have been and the books I have read, this book hits the mark. We need more like it.Good Job!"
Very Positive,"One of the most often used metaphors for inner growth is the travel journal and I'm sure Kerouac would have enjoyed Gurdjieff's somewhat autobiograhical travel novel ""Meetings with Remarkable Men."" Has this generation (2007) not yet found it's Dharma Bums? Maybe the line between literature and music is blurring (thanks to Dylan, Bob that is). Where is the excitement of adventure that leaps off the pages of these books stirring an energy to do something now, to seek, to find, to discover!!I would have every 14-20 year-old in America read Dharma Bums (and Electric Kool Aid Acid Test)... it's up to YOU to put some adventure in YOUR LIFE... IT'S YOUR LIFE!"
Very Positive,"The Dharma Bums has the Jack Kerouac style that On the road carried, but is faster paced than the authors most famous work. The themes are drastically different also, On the Road being a sensualist's dream, and Dharma Bums being the down to earth maturity that came from years of living on the road. Nature is a key factor in the book, its no Walden but the way Kerouac intertwines nature, Buddhism and the American dream is a very entertaining read. I would recommend this book over On the Road simply because it is shorter and blends a variety of things that are uncommonly seen together. The only difficulty was having to look up a few terms in regard to the eastern religions, but even that doesn't detract from the flow of the book. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who liked On the Road, and if you haven't read any Kerouac, this is a good place to start."
Negative,"This is Jack jumping into the Budda scene. Good if you feel like you need a Zen fix, and his observations on how to aspire to happiness are actually quite good too."
Very Negative,Not as advertised. These copies are remaindered and are marked on the bottom as such with a felt-tip line. I had purchased this as a gift but was unable to give it due to the remaindered marking. The online information about these books fail to mention their remaindered status.
Neutral,"Kerouac's most interesting work especially if you're interested in the beginnings of American Buddhism. Chronicles a time where the author and Gary Synder traveled together. Not great literature, but interesting from a historical perspective."
Negative,"... I just couldn't get into this book. It's a beat classic, so I hear, and it's about traveling and living free and enjoying life on lots of levels. From the descriptions and glowing reviews, I figured I should have loved it. I even read it while I was traveling up the US/Canadian west coast, and I grew up familiar with many of the areas mentioned in the book. In spite of all that, I didn't like it at all. For one thing, it's full of these obscure Buddhist terms and concepts, and although religion is sort of a hobby of mine, I didn't know enough to make sense of all the boddishatva-dropping, and the writing wasn't good enough to make up for that. I guess I just don't like it when the narrator introduces dialogue with ""sez I."""
Very Negative,"As of this review, the Kindle edition cost $12.99 and the paperback cost $10.88 - or over $2 more expensive for a digital version that actually saves the publisher money. I actually enjoy Dharma Bums, but Penguin should be absolutely ashamed of themselves for this. I wanted to reread this on my Kindle, but Penguin has decided to screw the readers who keep its business afloat. I'll be sure to keep this in mind for future purchases.Also, for those who will bash my review, the cost of the book is an essential to the value proposition of a book. There are constant bad reviews for publishers that break up short story collection and sell them individually for the price of an individual book. This is no different. Penguin wants me to spend nearly $300 for a Kindle and a case so that they can charge me more for books, all while they save money on production costs??? You've got to be joking!"
Positive,"As bad as it may sound I had not heard of Jack Kerouac until very recently. In my defense he died a year before I was born and although I have always been a reader it took until now for my reading interests to expand and give me this opportunity. I am enjoying Dharma Bums a lot as it speaks of things that are just as important today as they were when it was written like living a simple life is more free than living a consumer driven one. I have even started looking into Jack to know more on who he was and those he references in the book (look online to find who the real people are compared to the character names; one being Poet , author Gary Snyder). I also plan on buying the book ""on the Road"" scroll version which is the recomended version."
Negative,"I'm amazed at how many people find the Dharma Bums worth reading. It's Kerouac at his flattest. The sentences lack his usual energy and lyrical beauty, there is virtually no action and the Buddhist philosophy feels pasted on and contrived. This is definitely not a Kerouac book to recommend. Readers would to better to pick up a copy of Desolation Angels or (excepting the 140 pages of transcribed conversation in the middle) Visions of Cody. If you've already read lots of Kerouac and you want to move on to a modern counterpart, pick up Vincent Czyz's Adrift in a Vanishing City ... lyrical, experimental, hot-house writing that takes a quick-talkin drifter out of his native Kansas as far afield as Berlin, Mexico City and Paris. And through it all, he never loses his vernacular, even when waxin metaphysical. You might also try sliding over to Henry Miller ... not Tropic of Cancer, which is his most popular, but Sexus, which is far better written."
Positive,Great read. If you have something mote profound to read I would suggest that. All in all a great story though.
Very Negative,"Uninteresting and boring, the story accomplishes nothing from start to finish. Save your time and money and dont bother with this book."
Very Positive,"I am so fussy about my sheets that I spend a mint on sheets, so I was a little nervous about buying 19.99 sheets from amazon sight unseen. These are wonderful. They do not ball up and are as soft as can be. They are the kinda sheets when you run your legs back and forth they are cool and soft. I am going back for more at these prices for the rest of my beds in the house."
Very Negative,"I went into this movie hoping it could be better than TF2. It is, but not by much. I'm going to be honest. I think Transformers 2 is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I don't know why I saw the 3rd one, but the Chicago part looked interesting. Little did I know it would take 2 long boring hours to get that part. On top of that. It wasn't even that impressive. I hate Shia's parents. I hate his new girlfriend. I hate Michael Bay humor. I hate this movie and I hate the fact I spent 12 bucks to go see it. I don't think Michael Bay understand that everything gets boring without a plot or some kind of tension going on. It's so BORING. I literally sat in the theater hoping it was over only to look at my watch and see that only 10 minutes had passed."
Negative,"Not what I expected, the first Transformers was the best. The special effects was great but acting was not, too bad."
Very Negative,the movie was bad the kid ruined it yellign and being angry the whole time. And it was the same as the last 2 movies nothing out very boring ending was ok.
Very Positive,have always been a lover of the transformers ever since the childhood days. followed it from the very first movie that was created. great sound effects along with visual. went to see all of them at the theatre & then decided that I wish to own. even became a fan of the soundtrack. non stop action.
Very Negative,I have not received it yet am very disappointed as I was told I would get it by the official release date am still waiting
Negative,"First, I really enjoyed the movie. Like the other two films, this was a lot of fun to watch because you can disengage and simply enjoy the action.The bad news is that if you care anything about extra features, this is not the release for you. A blu-ray like this is completely unacceptable and is truly a money grab. Wait for the next release which is suppose to come out later this year. From now on I'll pay more attention to the release notes. I haven't bought anything like this in quite some time."
Negative,"I enjoyed the first Transformers immensely. It was quirky, fun and exciting. I'd heard Dark Side of the Moon had recaptured some of that magic. And at first it mostly did. But then, like so many big budget action movies it devolved into noise, machines smashing one another one frame after another, after another, after another... And at over 2.5 hours in length you reach a point where you stop caring. You could edit out a third of the content and it would have been a better movie."
Very Negative,"At least the other Transformers movies had Megan Fox for eye candy. Rosie-my-plastic-surgeon-went-berserk-with-the-silicone-and-that's-why-I-have-ginormous-lips-that-don't-move-Huntington-Whiteley is ugly. My eyes hurt from watching her and this movie. Rented this movie only out of morbid curiosity. There, that's all that needs to be said."
Very Positive,Dark of the Moon 3D is great! This is why I purchased a 3D TV for action films that make you feel like you are part of the action....
Neutral,"I bought this with much anticipation of liking this movie a lot. Sadly, it was a disappointment. Although there was a lot of action and great special effects, the transformers were too corny and eventually very boring."
Very Negative,This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Poor Shia has to have a high paid model to make his acting look better.
Neutral,"I loved the movie, but the quality of the DVD is bad, bad, bad. When it starts I always have to turn off the subtitles. Why? The picture is fuzzy, but generally ok. That's what I get for looking for a discount."
Positive,"I loved loved this movie! I mean wow! But For some reason everyone say's Rosie is a terrible actress, Personally myself I loved her in this not only because she was smoking (I'm a straight girl btw) but because I just loved the personality that she brought to the screen she made it sexy and just empowered. I loved, the CGI, all the effects are beyond amazing. I like that they used flashbacks of president Kennedy that was really awesome. I would recomend this if you have the time cuddle up and watch this. When I was watching it, time flew by it truly just caught me in, A little towards the end maybe 45 mins or so I got a little distracted with other things it started to just get a little predictable, But overall This movie was amazing :) I'd def. watch it again not only for Rosie but for the amazing actors. I wish there was more Josh Dunhamel in this :( He's down right hot lol:)"
Very Negative,"I really enjoyed the first two live-action Transformers movie but this one ... no! I was definitely disappointed with the casting of Sam's new love interest. There was a lot of action but it seemed ""action for the sake of action."" I felt that the picture ""worked too hard at being good."" There were times I couldn't tell who was autobot and who was decepticon. Some of the scenes were extremely crude and others tried my patience. So no Megatron, no Ironhide, and no Sentinel Prime. We have the one-armed Optimus and the unscaved Bumblebee. Agent Simmons was there being well ... he was there. Better luck next time, Bay."
Neutral,"Nice movie. Much better than Revenge of the Fallen. Much better script with some nice historical twists. Better acting in general including the new girl. As for the blue-ray version of this movie it falls really short of what a blue-ray release should be and what customers are already used to. No extra disc with background information such as interviews, featurettes, deleted scenes, commentaries, bloopers, etc. No Digital Copy disc which is not necessarily a big deal but downloading a 2.24GB file is a bit too much for those of us with data caps from our internet providers (40GB in my case). Seems like a marketing strategy for a future trilogy release (Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Bourne, Lord of The Rings, etc) which it is not fair to customers. In all a nice movie with better story and acting but an incomplete blue-ray release."
Negative,I've tried watching this movie twice now and have fallen asleep about half way through each time. The opening plot is really boring and the 3D is flat and uninteresting. Good 3D needs to have a few things flying out of the screen once in a while ... this doesn't. My friends tell me the ending is pretty good but I've never stayed conscious long enough to see it.My advise - get the new Resident Evil 3D instead - if you like stuff flying around this has it --- POW!Cheue
Neutral,"Loved the first two films & was very happy with the 2-disc DVDs. This film however in my opinion & I'm sure there will be a lot of dissension was over done, over long & under featured on the blu-ray/dvd combo pack. I am seriously glad I did not see this in the theater in 3d because it must have been totally overwhelming. I could not wait for it to end. Sorry but sometimes less is a lot more. Except where features are concerned. Total lack is very disappointing but I won't be repurchasing another copy."
Negative,"A waist of time, money, and brain cells. Do not waist your time with this pointless drivel. This makes me hope they never make another attempt at a Transformers movie."
Neutral,I loved the other transformers movies and still had fun watching this one. It just wasn't as great as I had hoped. Another thing I didn't like is that the show drops the F*** bomb. GP13 with the F word?! I don't get that.
Negative,"I am not a professional movie critic, but I love movies. This was a poorly written movie and that's why I gave it two stars. The focus for this movie was clearly to make money utilizing graphics and taking advantage of a strong fan base. After watching it, I understand why Megan Fox turned down the opportunity to be in it. I would give you examples from the movies as to why it was so horrible, but let's just say it was that forgettable."
Very Positive,Totally loved the movie. We have all ready watched it twice. Would recommend it to anyone. Can`t wait until another Transformers is made.
Negative,"I am only writing this spoiler-alert review because most people have already seen this movie:This time Michael Bay pushed science fiction beyond the limits of credibility, and that's where he lost me.I can see alien robots flying all over the place and destroying everything in their path, but THAT GIRL WITH THAT GUY WHO HAS NO JOB, AND NOT CHEATING ON HIM WITH HER ALPHA-MALE BILLIONAIRE BOSS? -ABSOLUTELY NO WAY!!!Now, to Michael Bay's credit: the acting and the special effects are incredible. Specially the scenes where she is riding in Sam's old deplorable car acting like it's no big deal for her. Those scenes do look real."
Positive,"HI Everyone, I was looking into the specs of this Bluray and it doesn't say if it is a Multiregion Disc? In the European site it says... Multiregion."
Negative,3D is all about pop outs gimmicks which is all missing here there is depth but average not that great. The movie & audio both are great but everybody was anticipating one of the best 3d blurays which is not the case. There are many other movies like Resident evil Final destination 4 & 5 and many others which have awesome 3d effects. If you have already bought the 2d version do not regret.
Negative,"Same as all the other recent transformers movies, dull and bland, completely emotionless. The story lacks excitement, and only the occasionally good special effects made me sit through it."
Very Negative,"I bought this during a Black Friday sale; the digital copy was significant part of my purchasing decision. Inexcusably, the digital copy code expired before this product was sold. At a minimum, this should have been disclosed in the product description."
Positive,"FYI: As of November 28th 2012, the Product Details for ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy) (2011)"" contains the wrong Format - this Blu-ray disc does NOT have DTS Surround Sound. You can see for yourself when you zoom in on the back cover photo. I've already submitted an ""Update Product Info"" request, and will keep the movie because I bought it on a great Black Friday promotion, but I just wanted to let others know in case it influences their purchase."
Negative,"No special features at all, on either disc, just the movie. Not at all what I expected from a Blu Ray/DVD combo pack."
Neutral,"My family & I are avid Transformers fans, however this movie wasn't as good as the previous movies. I purchased simply to have in our movie line up."
Positive,"Product was as described and advertise arrive on time or within the promise arrival time , totally satisfied with my purchase , Price was good"
Negative,"Please for the love of God, don't spend more than $1 renting this shlock from Redbox. We must, as good people, take away Michael Bay's monetary motivation for creating loud, unnecesary, incoherent, chaotic and useless trash. The first Transformers movie was great...witty, funny, character-driven and exciting. Then, taking a lesson from his shlock-meister mentor, Jerry Bruckheimer, Michael Bay made the next two Transformers sequels in the manner of a spoiled child with WAY too much money, with a shiny new train set, smashing it all together repeatedly knowing mommy and daddy will simply buy him more. No soul. No humor. No brains. Just a mind-numbing and whirling mish-mash of metal carnage with bigger and bigger explosions. It actually hurts the eyes. You find yourself having to close your eyes to avoid a headache."
Negative,"This movie is an action pack for the year, but the chapter transitions on this DVD BluRay version are not smooth with blank screens. Several features and clips were missing from the Theatre version. You would regret to have bought this version and should wait to get the later version with all the available added features."
Neutral,"In short, if you are looking for a high-action movie with fantastic special effects featuring giant robots pummeling and shooting one another, you can't do much better than this. The story is spotty, the characters exagerated, and everything is completely unrealistic, but that's not what you're watching this movie for, right? It's a decent action movie, but it isn't great."
Very Positive,I really enjoyed this movie. It had alot of action and kept me entertained through out. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys action movies!
Negative,"Glad this was free on Amazon Prime. Good effects, terrible plot.It was such a departure from the first two. I won't ever turn a movie off but this was as close as it gets."
Negative,Just when I thought it couldn't get much worse than Revenge of the Fallen...I watch Dark of the Moon. The cheesey (and canned) music score. The overused panning camera shots with a low sun hanging just over the horizon. The also overused helicopter shots. The nonsensical and unending action sequences that leave anyone with a modicum of logic scratching their head in bewilderment (and mild disgust). The inept plot. Shia LaBeouf screaming and overacting. Hot model running around death and destruction in high heels. The endless stream of former A list actors showing up. Etc.This movie is another train wreck. Thank god I streamed it using Prime and didn't pay for it in the theater or on DVD.Ugh.
Very Negative,"This is an awful franchise and this could be the worse of the bunch. This film is too dumb for adults and way to crass for children. I don't know who's giving the good reviews, it must be highly paid movie industry workers. This movie is really, really bad!"
Negative,"Although the modern Transformer series has incredible special effects, a movie needs more than that. The Transformers we new when we were younger were different, openly honest and strictly adhering to moral standards; but with the newer version,even the Good ones seem to be a bit more sinister and we're not always certain that they are on our side. The transformation sequence is extremely confusing and hard to follow, unlike the simpler older style. I do not like many movies these days because Hollywood seems bent on reinventing the legend of whatever character or franchise they take on, for their own purposes. There is some of that here. With some unnecessary bathroom humor as well. Strictly for special effects fans only."
Negative,They should have stopped after the first film. More bad acting filled in with fighting sequences that are way too long.
Very Negative,"I grew up on transformers and, quite frankly, the 15 seconds of 'me grimlock' overheard in 'the Professional' had more going for it than ANY of these terrible terrible movies."
Negative,"I mean, 2.5 hours? Really? The story line is so simple, this could easily have been a taut 90 mins and we all would have been a lot happier. I actually have not seen the first two in this series, so this only starts to make some limited sense after a long while. Anyone should be able to watch, though, and get it, thus the editing here needed more work. The absurdly plumped up lips of the girlfriend continuously transfixed me, way more than the silly transformer action fight sequences. Speaking of which, that is where all the fat is here. The fighting could have been seriously cut and no one would have complained except maybe the kids who made this comic book movie. Is anyone surprised to learn that the bad guys/good guys theme ends with the good guys in charge, yet again?"
Negative,"This thing works sometimes, and its cheep. Other then that I don't have much good too say about it. It uses up the ink in the expensive cartridges like water. And is so noisy it sounds like a truck going off road. I've owned quite a few cheep HP ink jet printers, and I've been disappointed by them all. I am going with Epson or paying a little more for a higher model HP. In the print world, you get what you pay for and buying cheep is a bad idea."
Neutral,"The safety pins were adequate, but they weren't as sturdy as I would have liked. The size was just right."
Very Negative,"If you are looking for a movie with bad acting-cliche lines-and never gonna happen action sequences this is the movie for you! Otherwise, I wouldn't even waste a Netflix rental on it."
Neutral,"I'M NOT A JOHN CENA FAN! HE'S SUCKS AS A WRESTLER/A RAPPER/AND AS AN ACTOR! AT LEAST DWAYNE ""THE ROCK"" JOHNSON HAS PROVEN HIMSELF (IN SOME MOVIES) THAT HE CAN ACT BUT CENA HASN'T! THE OLY GOOD THING ABOUT THIS MOVIE ARE THE ACTION SEQUENCES,BUT BAD ACTING ON ALL THE ACTORS IN THIS MOVIE INCLUDING ROBERT PATRICK WHO PLAYED THE BAD GUY,HE ACTED BETTER IN ""TERMINATOR 2:JUDGEMENT DAY"" AND AS AGENT JOHN DOGGETT IN ""THE X-FILES"" SERIES!"
Very Negative,"I have to say this movie is beyond ridiculous! When watching an action movie like this, one should have an open mind and realize that this is a fatasy world, but....... ""The Marine"" is summed up in one sentence in the film. As one character says to Robert Patrick's character(who starred in T2 Terminator 2)and says this guy is like the Terminator!.......That was the funniest line in the movie, but this guy isn't the Terminator and he escapes too many sure deaths for me to take this movie any more serious than an old Looney Tune cartoon! The acting is terrible and the characters are not intersting.....in short...this movie SUX!"
Very Negative,"We ordered this plaque as a house warming gift. We were under the impression based on the photo, that the plaque would be able to be hung on the house. When we received the item, not only was the number of the house not in the center, like pictured, but it came with 2 steaks to be inserted into the ground, with no way to hang it on a house. I understand it says ""lawn"" in the title, but it is clearly pictured hanging on stone. I contacted Shopzeus stating that the number was not in the center and it couldn't hang on a house. They sent a new one, with the number in the center, but still unable to be hung on the house! I contacted Shopzeus again and asked for either a full refund or a plaque that can be hung on the house. It has been over 2 weeks and they have not answered my email. This item is very misleading and should not be pictured as it is, if it can only be used in the lawn. I am extremely dissatisfied with this product and would never buy from Shopzeus again."
Very Positive,I bought this book for my friend Lorna for all she has done for me and she got a kick out of it
Positive,"eMarker has updated the drivers on their site. The product is now able to support Windows 95, 98, Me and 2000. I bought several as stocking stuffers for Christmas."
Negative,"The eMarker is a wonderful and innovative idea. The size is right and the price is reasonable (a little cheaper would be nice, but its acceptable). The big problem stems from the fact that Sony has no Mac support... or support for a number of other platforms as well. It's not like its hard to make the eMarker compatible with these systems. Sony is only shooting themselves in the foot. If this product were to support the Mac, it would be a 4 or 5 star product."
Very Negative,"I thought this product would be great, and help out my kids a lot!! My daughter hates it and it is so confusing. We can't find a lot of just regular songs. It is easier just to call the radio station and find out yourself."
Negative,I bought the Sony E-Marker because I thought it was a great idea. I am the type of person who does not remember who sings what and the title of songs. I was estatic when I received it in the mail and could not wait to start using it. To my disappointment when I went to download the driver I found out that it is only compatiable to Windows 98. I am currently running Windows ME. I tried to contact emarker for support with no luck or response. I have no idea when an update will come out so basically I have a product that I would love to use just sitting on my desk taking up space.
Neutral,"The idea behind this product is a great one, but the back up for the product is lacking quality. One of the greatest downfall of the product, is the inability to set which Radio Station you where listening to at the moment. I listen to about five different radio stations on my way to work, changing the stations constantly. It wouldn't be so bad looking through the list of what songs where playing on my preset stations if flash wasn't used. I think the use of flash is a bit of overkill. It kills the functionality of the device. Having to wait for its data to load. I think a simple page with great graphics and no animation would have been much better. If you got 20 bucks to burn, and want a cool gadget that grabs attention, get it. If you seriously want to use this often, with more than one radio station, I personally wouldn't get it. It's great though if you only listen to a couple of radio stations."
Positive,"Ignore all those bad reviews if you have some knowledge of the internet and computers. Yes, you do need to have patience to set it up. However once I got everything downloaded, I was in business. It is the coolest toy I ever got for [the price]. Maybe the reason I haven't had any problems with it is because I live in the NY Metro area. Do the marks sometimes take twice? Yeah, so you delete them. I have had none of the problems listed in the other reviews, mine works perfectly...and all my frieds cannot wait to get one too!"
Positive,"Scary Story Series4 star ratingThe scary story series by Alvin Schwartz are extreme books that keep you on the edge of your seat. Each book from the series contain many spooky tales that will make you shiver. One of the books from the series is called, ""Scary Story's to tell in the dark."" If you enjoy being frightened or anxious, you should read this book, but if you get scared easily, you may not want to read it. Many of the stories in this book include the dead, blood, noises, and other scary things that may frighten kids under five or sensitive people who get scared greatly. So mainly, you just have to choose to read it based on who you are as a person. If you do like these type of stories, this book is good for halloween parties, camping, sleep-overs, or just for fun when you feel like reading. I really enjoyed this book, you will to."
Very Negative,"Shame on Harper Collins for re-releasing these books without Stephen Gammell's artwork! These ""new"" drawings are awful and ridiculous. Buy The Scary Stories Treasury instead, as it has all the original books intact."
Negative,"This may be an awesome book for children who are not too sensitve and love to be scared. However, for the more senitive child, it can be very disturbing. A teacher read some of the stories to my 4th grader's class months ago and he is still having trouble sleeping. The pictures are what has bothered him the most. He can't seem to get them off his mind. So, be selective about with whom you share this book. You may have some unhappy parents if you choose to read it to a group."
Very Positive,"I first read Scary Stories To Tell In The Dark at age 7, (I'm 17 now) after stumbling upon it in my cousin's closet. I couldn't sleep after reading it, (complements of Stephen Gammell's illustrations) and immediatly bought the whole series.My favorite story out of the whole series is ""Harold"" in Scary Stories 3; I won't ruin the story for you, lets just say you'll never look at a scarecrow the same way again.Also, the notes in the back of the books on the origin of the stories is often as interesting as the stories themselves, as you often get some slight variations.My advice to any horror fan would be to buy this series, no matter your age, I think you'll enjoy them."
Very Negative,"This is being written mostly in protest of the re-print. The stories in these series were always a little dull. But the art, the art was fantastic, and now they've taken it away. I dont have my old copies any more and now the old books are going for outrageous sums. I wanted to get these books for my kids someday--not any more."
Very Negative,"I grew up on these books and the biggest part of their allure and charm was the nightmarish and frightening artwork by Stephen Gammell. I am EXTREMELY disappointed that they are being re-drawn with a washed out and flowered up style. Please take my advice and buy the original, it is definitely worth it, I promise. I think it is sad that some children will never know the original drawings because parents are too uptight and make a big fuss about them. Too sad. They are SUPPOSED to be scary, you know?"
Very Negative,"Reading these books left a huge impression on me as a child. The tales were scary, but the original artwork was what was truly horrifying. I loved these books and was looking forward to sharing them with my children when they are old enough to terrorize.It's inexplicable that the publishers would ruin this series by changing what give it its power. Terrible mistake."
Very Negative,"I love Brett Helquist. His illustrations for A Series of Unfortunate Events, for example, are wonderful. However, his work does not belong here. Stephen Gammell's illustrations are really what made these books the classics that they are (no offense meant to Alvin Shwartz). I will be looking for copies with the proper illustrations as soon as I can find them."
Neutral,"I used to love these books as a child, they were creepy and surreal and most of that was due to the illustrations by Stephen Gammell. I can picture some of the drawings and they are STILL creepy. WHY mess with perfection? It was a perfect one-two punch of story and picture, and now they look pretty generic. Not NEARLY macabre enough. If you can find it, get the original illustrations, they'll skeeve you out properly!"
Neutral,"The book that I read Scary Stories to tell in the dark is a good book for kids who still believe in ghost and the others things. If you're going to read it to your brother or sister then it might be an interesting book for you. Just to give you a hint of what kinds of stories it has.One of them is The attic, another is The Viper and there are so many more."
Neutral,"Most songs on this collection are the original versions with a couple of remixes included:1. My Prerogative2. Ain'T 2 Proud 2 Beg3. Poison4. She's Got That Vibe5.

Very Positive,"I read ""Water Street'' in one sitting. I couldn't put it down. The characters are warm, the writing is pitch-perfect and the stories flow like Jim Beam. Crystal Wilkinson is Alice Walker on Prozac."
Negative,"Is this an exercise video? It moves too slowly with too many breaks to give a decent workout to the intermediate bellydancer.Is this a dance instruction video? It assumes you already know a good bit about bellydance, and leaves the beginner to improvise too much.The only part I found helpful, as the previous regular user of several other bellydance videos, was the veil and finger cymbal portion. I'm thinking of buying some finger cymbals now!"
Positive,"I'm a beginner at bellydancing, and I found this video quite helpful. I wasn't sure about how well it would teach me at first, until I started performing the moves along with the tape- the camera angles are very clear, and each move is demonstrated succinctly. I suggest anyone using this video also stand in front of a mirror while performing the moves to get a clearer understanding of the instructions, or else it can be difficult to know if you are doing the moves correctly. Enough moves are taught to make a very decent dance, although some help with choreography would have been more helpful than just suggesting that the dancer ""improvise"". Even the performace sequences are somewhat helpful, if just to see the variety of costumes. The historical information at the beginning is also a great touch."
Very Positive,"This is a great introduction to belly dancing! This starter video takes you through many moves for the dance with a peek at veil work, finger cymbals and costuming. Good value for the time and quality of instruction.Unfortunately, you can learn some of these moves incorrectly with this or any tape. If you can, find a local class/instructor. Plus, it's more fun to learn with a whole group of women!!"
Very Negative,"I'm sorry, but these are horrible for teaching belly dance. Atea is very stiff & stilted & her chorus dancers CANNOT dance! It is absolutely Scary!I have never seen anyone (in person or in a video) dance the way that they do in this video. If you are interested in learning to dance, please, choose another instructor!"
Positive,"I ordered this video along with two others by Atea. It is a good introduction for beginners, easy and fun to follow along. But it is obviously dated, both in hairstyles (big hair!) and video quality. I hope Atea will make an updated version of this tape.In the event she updates the video, my suggestions for improvement would be:1. Move the history of the dance to the end of the tape, merely because when you are using it as a workout video, it's a pain to have to fast-forward past that portion every time you want to dance.2. More full-body shots so one can see exactly what a dancer is doing with feet, arms, etc., rather than focusing on one part.3. Atea is a good dancer, but she is stilted when speaking in the video and obviously reading cue-cards. I think she should stick to the dancing demonstrations and do a separate voice-over for instructions, or better yet, use someone with a more relaxed and natural voice for instructions."
Positive,"This is my second pair, the first are wearing like iron and I wanted to make sure I could replace them."
Very Positive,Bought this for Michigan winter. Keeps my feet warm and dry. Works fine on icy surfaces as well. Will test its durability now
Neutral,"I purchased these boots to have a better foot/ankle experience while hiking in the local mountains. They definitely helped my feet and ankles be more comfortable. The one down side has been the top of my toes keep getting rubbed raw while hiking. The first time I hiked in them I thought it was due to breaking in and maybe another pair of socks would help (I had on 1 pair of good hiking socks). So the next time I went out I wore 2 pairs of socks, but the same thing happened. I have now hiked many times (so boots are broken in) and I always have rubbed some toes raw. Not sure why, but I think it maybe there is too much distance between the boot and the top of my foot (I have normal size feet and have never had this happen before). So overall I like the boots, but they don't seem to like Me."
Positive,"I ordered my boots because they sounded great. I am not disappointed,they are great right out of the box.Fit well except the tongue is very short and could fit better around the ankle more. My order was delayed because of the snow but i am happy to finally be wearing them. Thank you very much for selling these fine and affordable boots. P.S I will spread the word to all the people i know who want happy feet. signed Mark Berglund"
Very Negative,"I am writing this review after I confirmed that my first pair of these boots are bad with manufacturing defect. After reading all these excellent reviews about the Altitude IV, I purchased a pair with high expectations. However, my first pair had a defect in the left shoe. It lacked arch support and it was uneven on the bottom which made my foot hurt. At first, I thought it was just the insole which I put in another pair on top of what is in the boots. However, it did not help, and my foot continued to hurt. Today, I went to a retail store and tried out another pair of the same model and size, and the arch support is great in both feet with proper insole cushion. I promptly exchanged my boots.All in all, my point is that I am disappointed with Hi-Tec for making bad shoes and still allowed them to be sold. 5 star for these boots but 1 star for the poor quality control."
Negative,"Length:: 0:05 MinsI researched all types of hiking boots on the web, and these are the best. Good durability, comfort etc. I finally ordered the boots and waited. Finally the boots arrived, and yes they were very comfortable and arrived in good condition. Unfortunately the Dark Chocolate color is so dark that it is almost black. I am sure this will grow on me, but the picture on the web site is inaccurate and gave a false expectation. The picture is just a little darker than the CHOCOLATE color, but the reality is different. Actually the color is nice and it will hide the dirt, just not what I expected."
Positive,This is a great boot. Light with good arch support. I wear them in mud and rain and my feet are dry and warm. Well worth the money.
Neutral,"The Boots are great for about two months then break down fast.I think the construction could be alot better,I hope that it can be improved on"
Negative,"The right boot sole was defective, had like a ridge on the outer edge making boot very uncomfortable to walk in. Return and refund procedure was painless. This was the second pair of these boots that had defective sole."
Very Positive,"I've had an older pair of these same boots for years, and it was finally time to replace them due to wear. It looked around at various brands for the same type of boots, and ended up back at these Hi-Tec Altitudes again. The appearance and value of these boots is hard to beat. I bought a pair in black and dark chocolate and they're both great boots. The sizing was accurate, and the boots fit perfectly."
Very Positive,"I buy a new pair of Hi-tec's like these re-occuringly. Waterproof, not bad to look at, pretty comfortable and very long wear. Recommend to got a width wider when ordering (if you're in a climate where in the winter you'd want thick socks)."
Very Positive,"My husband loves the look, fit, comfort, and durability of these boots. He has been wearing the Hi-Tec Altitude IV in Dark Brown for at least 14 years. He enjoys working outside and gives these boots a run for their money. The waterproofing works great. A pair of these last him at least a year. The dark brown doesn't show the wear and the boots generally still look ok when he throws them away, but he actually wears out the padding in the soles. I order these boots at least three pairs at a time, because I'm scared they will stop making them. I want this boot that he loves to remain popular and not be discontinued."
Very Negative,"Steve Milloy, author of this book, is a Washington, DC, lobbyist who has represented just about every polluting industry imaginable, especially the tobacco industry. If you doubt this, read the book Trust Us, We're Experts! by Rampton and Stauber, who have pages on Milloy, CATO, American Council on Science and Health, and their PR campaigns to smear health and environmental concerns as 'junk science' waged by evil public interest groups and activists like Ralph Nader. Pure industry propaganda."
Negative,"I bought this book thinking it would be an updated and improved version of the 1993 bookArmed and Female: Twelve Million American Women Own Guns, Should You?by the same author. That book was excellent, and I wanted to have the latest version.Unfortunately, what I received was a much more expensive ""pamphlet"" (only 160 pages for over ten dollars) that abounds with typographical errors, to the point that the errors change the meaning of the sentence in several places. As if that weren't enough, much of the content appears to have been cribbed from various blogs and Web pages that can be read for free after a simple Google search.To sum up: The 1993 version of Armed and Female is a well-written and interesting resource, albeit slightly dated in technical recommendations on ammunition, calibers, and of course the makes and models of available handguns.THIS book is unfortunately only an overpriced, badly printed rehash of information available elsewhere."
Very Negative,"While there is some very good information in the book, I ask you to consider the source. Ms. Quigley has testified on behalf of a woman shooting a gun down a hillside toward a strip mall at some dogs that were barking but not approaching her, that she was acting reasonably. The jury disagreed and convicted the defendant she was testifying for of grossly negligent discharge of a firearm. Her approach is a bit aggressive."
Negative,We were disappointed that this DVD would not play on our regular DVD player. We were able to play it on our computer. There must be something different about the format. Jim Jones
Neutral,"I remember the breathtaking scenery and the exquisite score of Maurice Jarre.... I have it on my coffee table with the intention of watching it this weekend. It was a wonderful movie, slow moving, but the characterizations were well done... This movie will only appeal to a select audience, there is no action, or special effects. A love story with a wonderful cast of characters in beautiful Ireland with a lush musical score.. "" It was the best time, It was the first time, It was a party just to be near you...."" enjoy and feast your eyes...!"
Negative,The DVD was fine - it would be useful if you explained about the regions and how you have to change your dvd program to watch the dvd.
Neutral,I bought this camera when it was new on display at circuit city and it worked great for a while but at some point the LCD quit working. I have had the camcorder close to five years and other than the LCD issue it is a great camcorder.
Very Negative,The camcorder worked only a couple of times.Then the playback picture was totally .......
Very Positive,"This compiliation of songs from gifted, Tony award winning composer Jason Robert Brown is a feast for the ears. For JRB fans, it is a chance to hear his signature style music and witty lyrics up-close and personal, without the constraints of a musical's plot. For newcomers to Mr. Brown's music, you'll get a taste of everything, from the gospel sound of ""Coming Together"" to the big band swing of ""Grow Old With Me"" to the spirited rock/musical sound of ""Getting Out"". My favorite is the ballad ""Someone to Fall Back On"", which he often uses as an encore at his live performances. The energy in the band and vocals captures the feel those live performances . This is a 'must-have' CD!"
Very Positive,"Hi, I'm Toney. I'm a 17 year old music lover, and an avid Musical Theatre performer. A good friend of mine introduced me to Jason Robert Brown, and I must say, since then, I've been addicted. Long, Long Road is most definitely my favorite of this album. I actually heard it for the 1st time at a showchoir competition, it was a groups ballad, thier rendition was wonderful, but afterwards, I purchased this CD, and again, JRB proved himself to be wonderful. I'm a young spirit, but definitely a fan, and I make certain to introduce my friends to what ""real"" music is. Jason Robert Brown's work is a prime example!"
Positive,"I am a huge fan of John Garcia (especially Kyuss and Unida), and was excited to hear this album. It is good, but not great. While Garcia's singing holds up, musically this band is not on par with his previous outfits. Still, a good listen."
Negative,"Gorecki's Quartet No. 3 performed by Kronos is not to everyone's taste even if they love classical music. It has a very special atmosphere --slow paced and repetitive, minimalist--only broken by the third movement: Allegro, sempre ben marcato. One could use it for meditation, as it is quite peaceful and monotonous with tiny changes happening in the harmony. Perhaps it would be useful for putting one to sleep. Yes, I think it could well be advertised for insomniacs and somnambulists."
Negative,"The samples sounded interesting, but a few spins revealed that there's really nothing of substance here. While I'll concede Connors sounds like a proficient guitarist, he's just not really playing anything here. The Airs pass by like a breeze, leaving nothing memorable behind. It is not substantial enough to be either good or bad."
Neutral,"Another book, which although informative, does not introduce anything new. I enjoyed this book more than my previous reading ""America the Vulnerable"". I feel that this author has the capacity to produce some really good books along similar lines."
Neutral,"More male vocals and hip-hop influence on this than ""The Acid Jazz Test, Volume 1"", so if the previous reviews here appeal to you, you will be even happier with ""Vol. 1,"" which includes better material by some of the same artists: instead of ""Do the Right Thing"" here, volume 1 has ""Set Me Free"" by the Bygraves,perhaps their finest tune. Jhelisa's ""All I Need"" and Karime Kendra's ""Never Give Up"" are two other standouts on volume 1. All three feature tasty female vocalists over a thick groove. Here the top tracks are Sound Assembly's ""Stoned Again"" and Brooklyn Funk Essentials' ""Stickman"""
Very Negative,"I bought this book for a friend going through a divorce, luckily I read it first. In a section about a father not being involved with his children they accuse the mother of not making him feel welcome, in a section about court they advise women not to wear short shirts or make-up and it only gets worse. This book was written to convince women to stay married so they don't loss their children."
Negative,"The NBC coverage offered in these videos is fascinating to watch as it shows a tragic, unfolding event as it was covered live in 1963. NBC's coverage was in black and white, except for brief segments early on from WBAP-TV in Fort Worth. The only problem with the videos is the actual video quality...which is lousy. THIS VIDEO IS NOT AN OFFICIAL NBC RELEASE. THE MATERIAL DID NOT ORIGINATE DIRECTLY FROM THE NBC NEWS ARCHIVES. IT IS A BOOTLEG. NBC only released one such video of its JFK coverage, a capsulized version back in 1988 which contains almost none of the coverage seen in this collection. This material is of marginal quality at best...and looks like it ewas copied about eight times before being released in this version. If you're not concerned about this, then you will find it very interesting to watch."
Negative,"I thought the Cd would be good after hearing Tubthumping and Amnesia but I was wrong..I feel that other than Tubthumping and Amnesia, there isn't anything about this Cd to boast about..."
Negative,"I thought ""Tubthumping"" was pretty good,no,really cool,but the rest! UGH! Those songs were a complete BORE. If you are planning on buying this CD, I strongly advise you not to. Buy a single of ""Tubthumping"" instead,or borrow it from a friend,if you don't have any friends,from a CD rental store.My apologies to the people who enjoyed this CD."
Negative,With no harmful intentions toward the movie brassed off.(thats where the talk at the begining of the song tubthumpin came from)Thank God I don't have any guns. Otherwise I wouldn't be here to write this review. What is this bait and switch. I first heard tubthumping on the radio very most excellent. Or so I thought. I bought the CD hoping for some good British tunes and what did i get. Stuff the baby on the cover could have written better. Please save shelve space never make another CD in this genre.
Very Negative,"i thankfully got this cd for christmas, so i did not have to waste my money on it, i liked ""tubthumping"" at the time. i had no idea about what a dissapiontment it would be. it's sounds too kinda ""un-musical"" i have no idea where they got some of those sounds from, but it's nothing that should be used it hte future. i have had this album for a whole year and still havn't listned to the whole thing.so, sample the rest of the somgs on a cd before you put it on your christmas wish-list!!!"
Very Negative,"This knife is terrible. It was cheap, so I should have been dubious about quality. Save your money for a better knife since you can easily cut yourself with this knife. It's made of cheap plastic and soft metal parts, so don't count on the blade locking properly. It's an insult to even have a fire fighter logo. Don't make the same mistake in buying this poorly constructed tool."
Negative,"This series is a huge disappointment, in comparison with the fine nature programming I grew up with on public television. The scientific content here is low, and thus the educational value is poor. Instead, we are treated to disaster porn--stitched-together footage of calamaties and their aftermaths, plus alleged ""human interest"" stories as shameless as anything on the six o'clock news. Insultingly voyeuristic, if that's possible for Americans these days."
Negative,"I purchased this printer with high expectations. But was very disappointed. Right off, I had problems with paper jamming and printer errors. I even think it jammed so much that a small piece broke off. When it prints the quality is great but I have had a lot of trouble with it when trying to print on card stock. It doesn't appear to be very sturdy and makes me very nervous every time I try to print more than a few sheets at a time. Even regular bond paper has a tendency to jam if printing more than a couple sheets at a time. I've always thought HP printers were the way to go, but after this one, I don't know if I'll buy another HP."
Neutral,"I have owned this printer for about a year ... purchased it for printing photos and was impressed with the quality. However, like one of the other reviewers, mine jams again & again. It feeds multiple pieces of paper and is just a pain in the ***. At $1/sheet for photo paper, jams are expensive and the ink just pools while it is jammed. It is a mess and a waste of ink and therefore $$$$. HP has been NO help as their warranty/technical support is for something ridiculous .. 3 months? Anyway, I've now purchased 2 printers in the last week, both are not as good in quality of photos .. they deliver a pinkish cast (Epson Stylus CX3200 & HP1200 (I think) ). I will try a Canon next I believe ..."
Neutral,The printer does deliver a nice quality picture and was easy to install. Its major disappointment is the cost of ink cartridges and the rate at which it uses ink. (Even when printing in gray scale). I now know to more thoroughly research the next printer I purchase for its long term efficiency and costs of ink. As far as usage goes the printer has worked well for over a year without any problems or crazy complications.
Very Negative,"I hate this printer! It is nothing but problems. Every single time I go to print even a single page, there is some sort of problem! The paper jams, I get timeout errors, the ink runs out too fast and I am unable to fill it with the refill kits. The thing has a mind of it's own and starts spewing out pages even when I'm not trying to print anything. It wouldn't be so bad if it didn't put trash on each page wasting my paper. It's a piece of junk! 1 Star is highly overrating this product!"
Neutral,"I bought this printer about a month ago and was slightly disappointed by its performance. The print quality is great, the photos I printed looked 99% like the 35mm prints that came from the lab, but I made the mistake of using 4x6 photo paper instead of the standard 8 1/2 x 11 sheets. Approximately every-other print came out crooked on the paper, and the printer has an annoying habit of cutting off the last inch of the image because of margin restrictions. I couldn't find an option to use the maximum paper margins, and so had to end up making a white border around the image so that the printout didn't look strange.I bought this printer as a replacement for a 5-year-old Epson brand, and am considering going back to it because of my frustrations with this HP. Summary: Great print quality and speed, but not good with custom paper sizes."
Very Negative,"I bought this printer based on the reputation of HP--not again. I have had it for 5 months and it just stopped working. I went to the web site to get troubleshooting info about the error codes. I have spent an easy 6 hrs working on it and nothing worked. It suggests calling phone support ""if you are still having trouble."" I called phone support but, because I had bought the printer more than 90 days ago, they wanted [money]per phone call--forget that. I email for support and it sent me a computer generated response redirecting me to the same web page I first started with. I am taking the [money] I would have wasted on the phone call just to get someone to read me the same damn web page and then ask me to phone back later and going to try a new brand of printer. HP no longer means quality!!!"
Neutral,I was excited as this is the oldest Duke movie I have seen. It is shocking to see him so young but he still looks the same and his acting is brill. This doesn't last long though.
Positive,All of these books that I have ordered are excellant. My grandaughter has me read them at least three times a day. We are both very happy w/ them.
Very Negative,"I know! I'm as surprised as you are that I didn't enjoy this much-touted classic! I added it to my list of summer must-reads, and it was probably the worst of the bunch. After the second or third time an expected dramatic climax was suddenly resolved by a literal deus ex machina, the thrill was gone. Maybe Asimov was being ironic?? I did enjoy meeting a trader who could've been a Han Solo relative, but that was the highlight. Asimov fans may enjoy this one, but I will stick to Clarke, Bradbury, and Heinlein."
Positive,"More like 4.975 Stars. If we had more books like this, who would watch TV. This book should be required reading in College Literature classes. I would love to see a well produced movie(s) for the Foundation Series - But nothing could ever be as entertaining as Asimov's fluid writing."
Very Negative,"The Foundation is completely undeserving of the fame accredited to it. Had it been more eloquently executed, the collage of textbook style narrative and bad dialogue might have been sufficient to generate a bearable story. All the social concepts Asmov brings up are well worn and ill-portrayed on the backdrop of a generic, illogical sci-fi universe. His writing style is bland and every one of his characters can be found by an other name in star wars."
Very Negative,"...It is awful, truly one of the worst books that I've ever read...Good writing does not not to be defended like this, and the need to defend a book in this way prety much proves that it is a substandard work."
Positive,"Very briefly, to the pair of one-star reviews below, keep in mind that these stories were written in the 1940's! Must you blame Mr. Asimov for ""inaccuracy"" in a time where much more mainstream sources felt that by 1980 we'd all be zipping around in flying bubble cars? Obviously you missed the point here. The Foundation series is about our own humanity, not about where we will be technologically in the year 15000. No, I can't prove that there could actually be a Mule, but why waste your time trying to? The Mule is probably one of the best literary constructs to grace the world of science fiction, one that isn't decked out in gadgets and laser beams. There's something to be said about a writer that can make a sci-fi villian without resorting to hi-tech hijinks. You didn't like the Mule? Well tough luck and go back to reading your Star Trek novels."
Positive,"Oh how avidly I read these long ago. Just ate them up. After learning Paul Krugman was influenced by theses novels, I had to read them again or so I thought. Dry though relevant ideas from a great mind; two thirds through the first, not one dialog with a female or a child. Really can't go on."
Negative,"The book starts with an enticing psychohistory idea, but then it dives deep into politics. It is quite interesting to read the ingenious solutions for the crises taken by the great leaders of the Foundation, specially for resigning war whenever it seemed the most sensible way out.The problem is that this book is supposed to be science fiction, yet the story seemed to have happened back in the mercantilism period in the XVII century, with its priests, kings, viceroys and merchant ships trading raw materials for manufactured goods. The gadgets used by the traders to fool the other empires are a bit silly as well, for a far future based science fiction."
Very Positive,"If you only read one sci-fi book this should be the one. Complex ideas delivered in a simple way, a great story written in an elegant style. I hunted down the hardback version because I know that this is one series I will want to re-read."
Neutral,"Yes, it's got some truly lovely ideas. But, no, I didn't especially enjoy reading it. Gripping storyline, anyone? Not here..."
Neutral,when I was child we read this story and did essays in high school ... today I find it hard to follow the story line or read more then a few pages at a time.
Positive,"Clever twists, incredible imagination, and a fun, quick read. Some of Asimov's ideas of future civilizations invoke awe even decades later. My only complaint is that the reader only gets to experience each generation for a single chapter, so character development is tricky and brief. Not as good as Ender's Game, but still worth reading."
Neutral,"I recently re-read this classic work of science fiction, and was pleasantly surprised to find it's still relevant today. The characters and language are a bit creaky, but the social issues Asimov raises are sound. Under what conditions is it ethical for a self-appointed academic elite to hoodwink and trick the general population for their own good? Phrased that way, the answer seems obvious -- under no conditions at all? -- but what if it really IS for their own good, and if disaster is the alternative?We don't have any better answers to those questions today than we did 70 years ago, when Asimov was writing."
Negative,"The book covers several generations, so with each generation you have to re-learn all the characters. It is difficult to keep track of who's who when every time you get to know the cast, 200 years suddenly pass and we're in the middle of a new crisis. I didn't read the whole series because of this -- it was obnoxious."
Negative,"No judgement againt asimov as a sci fi innovator, but i did not find the story telling to be very enthralling and felt almost no emotional connection to the series of characters introduced over large jumps in time.The method for introducing new twists or skipping decades by introducing fake abreviated ""encyclopedia galactica"" entries was awkward and rough."
Very Positive,"First I should say that this is a great book. It is the second book in the Foundation Trilogy. And if you need some help on the order of the books, here tis : 1)Prelude to Foundation 2)Forward the Foundation 3)Foundation 4)Foundation and Empire 5)Second Foundation 6)Foundation's Edge 7) Foundation and Earth. #s 3,4, and 5 are the original trilogy. I have reviewed all of them. They're all good. This particular book has two parts. In the first part the Foundation is faced with the dying but still strong Galactic Empire, and in the second, more interesting part, they face the rising Mule. A few words bout him, he's not what or who you might think he is. The next sentence might be considered a spoiler, so choose to read it or not. The Mule is actually Bobo( this word only appears once in the book, and might be missed). Well, have fun reading!"
Very Positive,"This is a great read. A lot of great characters, and interesting events take place. This book definitely advances the whole ""Foundation"" idea, but it does stand on its own."
Neutral,"I was disappointed with the Foundation books. I thought the story was thin. Surprisingly, the best of the Foundation novels is not the first but the fourth - Foundation's Edge. I don't understand what all the hoopla is about these books; they're ok, but definately not something I would reread. If you're looking for truly exciting sci-fi about the human condition and empire-building I would suggest trying Herbert's Dune."
Negative,I read the foundation books and was reminded why I don't like asimov. The man has Phd's in chemistry and a gazillion other physical sciences and he likes to show it off. And that makes it very hard for us lay scifi geeks.
Negative,"I was dissatisfied with this novel. Being an avid fan of Asimov and the Foundation series,the younger version of the mathimatical genius did not match with older one who changed the history of his race for the better; nor did I think that the story with female very appealing, again it did not match. The story seemed tacked on to the series just to write another novel. It is unfortunate that the writer who invented the positronic brain,the three law of robotics, and of course the genuis of the foundation series wrote such a tacked on story."
Very Negative,"Setup was easy enough, but this printer routinely goes haywire, spitting out a whole cartridge load of paper and refusing to print. I have tried it with several different PCs, with this same intermittent weird behavior. Only a reset of both the printerand the computer seem to fix everything.I'm off to buy an Epson!"
Very Negative,"I've had HP printers for years and have always liked them. However, this printer is a real headache. We've had 3 --taking the time for returns was a hassle. With each of these HP printers, the paper feed mechanism has been defective. With every document I printed, the feeder malfunctioned and the paper was torn or badly misaligned. I found out on the HP website that others have had similar problems with a number of HP printers--malfunctioning paper feeds. HP has done nothing to correct this problem. I've now become a Canon printer owner am quite happy with Canon printers--excellent quality and no problems. I'll never buy another HP printer."
Negative,"This movie is slightly digestible yet, for having ""A list"" actors and an acclaimed director, I have to review it tougher than usual.This movie is about a police officer that crosses the line. He steals, rapes, pillages and partners up with his adverseries. It's marginally entertaining but completely unbelievable...and that is the probem that I had with the flick. Nicolas Cage's character seems like he would have been extinguished right when he started acting like a nut.In a crime drama, there must be some semblance of reality of which this had none.The ending was terrible in this entertaining yet totally unbelievable movie. Werner Herzog is excellent with man-eating bears, obessessed opera lovers, cool nature flick and POW escape plots but, he was out of his element on this one."
Negative,"After reading the reviews I was excited to watch this film. I found the plot to be very drawn out, predictable, and somewhat dull. I would recommend watching this if you have 2 hours of your life that you don't mind squandering and don't care if you come away from that wasted time with nothing to show for it. Enjoy the film."
Neutral,This was a typical cop show and if you are looking for some pretty mindless entertainment this movie hits the spot.
Very Negative,this movie was the longest...boring movie i have ever seen. i didn't think he could ever do a horrible movie till this one. the whole movie shows him getting high and going on trips and setting people up for his mistakes...its a bunch of crap! maybe it would be good for someone that is really stoned out of their mind to sit down in watch.
Very Negative,All the other bad reviews are good enough for me. I'm just adding my vote on this one as a one star. I can't fathom how the ones who ranked it as 5 stars saw the same movie as I did. The best thing about this movie was returning it to the Red Box I rented it from.
Negative,"I would not recommend this book. Anyone looking into alternative fuel should consider biodiesel, or electric power. Ethanol is a waste. Anyway, this book provides some useless diagrams of how to not make a still at home."
Very Negative,"A disgrace to both REM and the work of good quartets. The idea is enticing, but the quartet's execution is awful. Truly terrible. Dull. Choppy. Uninteresting. Same. I'd say boring, but I can't stand to listen to it long enough to get bored. It's so bad I was compelled to log onto this website just to see if I could get my money back. I see the quartet doesn't even have a name -- I can understand why. It's advertised as just ""The String Quartet Tribute to R.E.M."" and it lists the players. Maybe someone else could do better, but I doubt it, as the arrangements are bad too. Sorry to say it, but this CD is truly awful!"
Very Positive,"I ordered these lock laces to use in a pair of winter boots. It has made putting the boots on a speedy process, and the boots fit snugly when the laces are locked in place. I will buy this product again."
Positive,"Works as advertised, wish I could just buy the locks without the laces. I use the locks on other items, works great holding my hat on in windy weather."
Negative,"They're back, not as Anita & Ray but as Romy and Marion. The song ""Wanna Get Up"" in (my) opinion is not as good as other tracks released by the band, since there's no techno-rapping by Ray, and not as good vocals & lyrics. On previous 2 Unlimited tracks Ray & Anita wrote most lyrics and sung well. On ""Wanna Get Up"" vocals are written by other producers. Struggling to make the song good, on many European charts it never made it into the top five. The single includes three remixes, the ""SASH! Extended Edit"" is the best remix, and song, which give the single the two of five stars. It is better than the original version. The other two remixes are extrermely poor and do not relate with the type of music 2 Unlimited sings."
Negative,"This is a nice looking feeder and it attracted lots of beautiful finches, but the squirrels quickly figured out how to pop out the plastic inserts so that the seed spills out onto the ground. It is a poor design to have removable inserts in the feeding ports. Overall, a waste of money as I have to buy a new one now."
Very Negative,"Love the show, which for me has held up well: it's obviously dated but still makes me laugh.What didn't make me laugh, though, was the quality of this DVD. The quality of the transfer, it's as though you're still watching it on VHS! It doesn't support surround-sound, even by just repeating the two channels.There are no subtitles in any language, and no special features of any kind!Worse, mine had scratches right out of the plastic! The scene where Jack comes up to the breakfast table in his speedos is all pixelated. Was that true for anybody else?"
Very Positive,"Wow, its about time. This is one of the best comedies ever made. It's sincere and fun. While a tad naughty at times, it NEVER disgusts or embarrasses parents in front of their kids. Todays comedies should learn from such a well made show. This collection will entertain for decades to come. I hope all the episodes are made available soon."
Very Positive,I was THRILLED to find this at Wal-Mart for $5.50. I LOVED this show growing up and now owning it and watching it again just makes me smile and brings back those memories. What a great show. We we always think of John Ritter fondly and miss him greatly.
Positive,there is only half a dozen episodes here. still they are pretty good. recommendedd if you can find it cheap
Very Positive,"While Dead Moon's ""studio"" albums are nothing short of brilliant, anyone who has seen them live knows that they are beyond comparison. Which is why both Dead Moon live albums are so great. As opposed to most live albums, which are all dolled up and clean, Dead Moon live albums are the closest thing to being there. Definately a great purchase."
Negative,"Its a very nice camera don't get me wrong. However due to its compact design, the speaker is too close to the tape motor. During quiet and not so quiet areas, you will hear a high pitched humm coming from your camera as well as on what you record. Canon confirmed this as a design flaw. The ZR45, 40 and 50 all do this. I was really disappointed, I returned mine.. I wish there was a way to fix it."
Very Positive,"I don't see how this is any different from the conventional (non-pet) lint rollers, except maybe that the handle is green? My dog likes to chew on this one more? Regardless, it works well (just as well as the regular version) for pulling coarse dog hair off just about everything. And so far, the handle has stood up to a few good chewing sessions."
Neutral,There was a lot of really good information in this book for those who are looking to know more about Buddhism but there were also several pages in the book which I found to be a little illrevilant to the common layperson.
Positive,"The contrived question and answer format didn't bother me too much, and actually covered a lot of ground in an engaging way. I liked this book."
Positive,Its a very interesting layout for this sort of book. Its in a question/answer format so it makes it really easy to understand
Neutral,"Nice concert from a skilled band, sound and vision are OK. This is not top class but enjoyable if you like jazzy blues."
Positive,"A number of books about substance abuse have come out since ""I'm Dancing as Fast as I Can,"" but it still should be on the bookshelves (or Kindle) of everyone directly or indirectly involved with addiction. Gordon's straightforward description of the mental, emotional, and physical symptoms endured by a recovering addict has a powerful universality. It helps all of us understand the complex and excruciating process of recovery. - Ann Seymour, author of ""I've Always Loved You"""
Positive,"You will cry. laugh, and love right along with this author as she dealves into the truth of dealing her with personal demons. So many ways to relate to this experience."
Positive,"With Cold Water you won't get the Hawaiian vibe of a pidgin vocal, but you can certainly enjoy excellent slack key phrasing and very capable compositional power. A treat for fans of finger style guitar."
Very Positive,"My husband was diagnosed with lung cancer more than 4 years ago, and I honestly do not know how I made it for almost 4 years without this book. It answers almost every conceivable question a person might have about lung cancer, and is the most comprehensive book on lung cancer, written in laymen's terms and very easy to read and understand, that I have ever found. I highly recommend it to anyone who has been diagnosed, or has a loved one who has been diagnosed with lung cancer."
Very Negative,"This film is a travesty of the action-adventure genre. First off, the plot is illogical and absurd even if it might be a policeman's dream: all the major criminals around congregate at a prison and kill each other in one enormous shootout. That essentially is the plot of the movie.Adding to the ""fun"" is excruciating, repetitive dialogue where the major characters attempt to bare their souls. At the end of these long-winded discourses, one fervently wishes these characters to be brutally killed for being so insufferably boring and pretentious.Oh yes, how can one forget the equally irratating mambo-inflected film score which blares loudly. and repetitively, over the soundtrack? Unfortunately, it's not loud enough to drown out the dreadful dialogue.Mean guns doesn't mean a thing."
Negative,"Albert Pyun has his own way of making films. He is responsible for ""Omega Doom"" and ""Crazy Six"", two movies that in spite of having quite different plots, possess in common the peculiar and curious way with which the director accomplishes his works. ""Mean Guns"" follows the Pyun's formula: many shootings and closes in slow motion,different and weird camera moviments, strange characters and a poor script. In this film, Lambert is a murderer who,along with other criminals, is trapped inside a prison and he needs to survive before his chances drain. Pyun substitutes idea and good-sense for excellent action scenes, that remind plenty of John Woo and Sam Peckinpah's best efforts. Unhappily, that is not enough to maintain the interest for this bad film."
Negative,"This is a beautiful book and terrific fun for a woodworker to read for enjoyment, but it's short on specific solutions. Attempting to be all things to all woodworkers, it is of little value to anyone--except to spark the imagination. The best part of the book are the beautiful photos that peek inside the workshops of great artisans around the country. But if you seek step-by-step advice, look elsewhere."
Very Negative,"I was highly disappointed with this cd. Perhaps I expected more of the Kharma era Sanders or any of his early 70's releases. Anyhow I've always experienced Sanders as somewhat of a self indulgent artist even on his best records and in fact some of his best playing really is on other peoples records so in some ways I'm not all that shocked at the medocrity of this cd. The music is bland, overwrought and trite somewhat similiar to any of the faceless and equally uninspired New Age releases that you might stumble upon. This cd should be avoided and if you want to here some more current Sanders check out Sonny Sharrocks album ""Ask The Ages"" that features Sanders without the pretension and self importance."
Positive,"This movie is so freaking action packed, you actually are asking for a break from it and when you get your break , this movie hits you with one of those really hard to take drama scenes.but the action is the reason to watch this. The camera work is outstanding the way they follow the motorcycle in one scene is really a rush just watching it. It opens up with action and gives you just enough to make it a really good movie.One of the MANY reasons I love this movie is the hero. I watch a lot of kungfu, and this type of storyline for mel is kungfu at it's finest. He really reminded me of a guy like Jimmy Wang Yu or even one of my favorites Chen Kwan Tai(baddie from crippled avengers). Mel plays the role just as good as any of them and maybe better.The commentary is also listenable and a pretty good making of."
Positive,"The first movie in the series is good, but, Road Warrior is better. but does that mean it`s bad? Heck no! This is actually one of the best of the sci-fi genre.It`s about this guy named Max, (duh!) who gets pissed at this motorcycle gang for killing his friend and family and seeks his hellish revenge."
Positive,"I loved the Mad Max movies,the first one is pretty good if you haven't watched it in a long time.I've never liked racing movies or high-speed pursuit movies except the Mad Max films...it's just good old-fashion action without slow-motion moments or re-hashed effects you see in modern movies.The movie has one thing I wished they changed-the legendary villian known as the Night Rider dies at the beginning of the film,yet throughout the film the biker gang he led honors his name deeply yet throughout the story you just don't get to see what made the Night Rider so legendary.Overall a good film."
Neutral,"In a post-apocalyptic Australia, Max (Mel Gibson) and his fellow officers try to keep order on the highways as nihilistic biker gangs grow ever bolder. We are given the definite impression that the final bastions of civilization are on their last legs as chaos encroaches.This film presents intriguing characters and a suitably bleak scenario. It starts strong, but it loses its energy before the end. Perhaps I was spoiled by seeing the classic action sequel ""The Road Warrior"" first. When Max goes mad at the end of this first film, director George Miller doesn't set the action sequences up very well or provide much of a payoff. The most exciting set pieces actually come much earlier in the movie. However, his next film will prove that he can be a master of action."
Neutral,"I don't recommend this edition. Ok, the picture is good and the Australian language track is quite cool but the movie is cut.In the scene in which Max visits the burned Goose in hospital has been censored meaning Goose's burned body isn't shown. Ok, maybe that's something not everybody wants to see but if I buy a special edition I expect to see the whole movie."
Neutral,I say that Mad Max is not as good as the others but you need to see it to understand whats going on and you need to watch Road Warrior first.
Positive,"Perhaps the only true Mad Max Movie and the one that makes the most sense(Or not?) good acting by Mel, Great Action and Cool Vehicles. Compared to what comes later in this franchise it actually makes sense in retrospect."
Negative,"I'm a great fan of the Mad Max series of films and since I'm living in Australia, I have seen the original Aussie version on video locally. It seems stupid that we can only get Mad Max 2 and 3 on DVD in Australia and not Mad Max 1 (which is only available on Video). So, because of this I bought Mad Max 1 (The U.S Version DVD) through Amazon which has the American voices dubbed over the original sound track (which I didn't know at the time). Me being Australian and having watched the original, I found the U.S version very disappointing. Also the picture quality on this US version DVD of Mad Max 1 should have been better (It's more like VCD quality). The Australian version of Mad Max 1, I would give 5 stars."
Neutral,"The original Australian theatrical release is best. This DVD looks fine. It has a crisp picture and good sound. I was however extremely dissapointed to hear the POORLY overdubbed American voices and miss certain cut sequences. Not only that but there are NO special features or extended menus, just a chapter search. This movie DESERVES a special studio upgrade. It must be remastered, uncut and include trailers, commentry, interviews etc. Mad Max is a new wave masterpeice and must be given the attention it's worthy of."
Neutral,The First was the Best..Simple story.. Violent .. but the ending could of been improved with a nice revenge (finished too quick) The 2nd one was dead slow but Not too bad and the third was kiddy violent..
Very Negative,"I thought this was going to be a good movie. Rotten Tomatoes gave it a 95%. It's the worst highly rated movie I've ever seen. My girlfriend and I kept saying ""WTF?"" the entire time we watched it. It made very little sense. The Road Warrior is much, much better."
Neutral,"This is an interesting film, which if occasionally a bit wooden, virtually created its own genre overnight, and made Mel Gibson a star.Perhaps its most noteable feature was George Miller's use of unusual camera angles, which created one or two iconic images. Sometimes it has the feeling of an exploitation film, but it never develops in that way and by today's standards it seems rather tame.It looks as though it was made on a pretty low budget, and I prefer the brasher sequels where a little more polish was added. It remains a film curiosity, but really not much more than that."
Neutral,"Having been consistently impressed with every Stereolab album I've had the chance to get my hands on, I was rather disappointed with this release. Whereas previous albums have flowed beautifully from one exceptional song to another (very different) one, this album represents a set of peaks and valleys--the peaks being far less numerous and/or unique, and the valleys being dull and virtually indistinguishable from one another.If I'm being unduly harsh, it is only because I've come to expect so much from this band. The album does in fact contain a few noteworthy songs, like Captain Easychord and Hallucinex, but these lack the uniqueness or catchiness to compete with older classics like Come and Play...Night, pack yr romantic mind or Metronomic Underground. Overall, this album is mediocre at best, and tiresome at worst. I only hope it doesn't mark the beginning of a downward spiral!"
Neutral,"this is my fave band ever. I own a whole ton of their cd's and listen to them more than any other band. This band's strong points through the years (and in their earth shattering concerts) have included experimentation with so many different genres, and yet making these genres surprisingly their own--another strongpoint has been the elemental nature to their songs-an urgent simplicity--an overpowering sound burst of pure, raw, deep sentiment--this album--while very good in many ways, feels overproduced--it just lacks that raw power of feeling and conviction that all their other albums have..."
Neutral,"Never seen this author before, but well researched, coherent story. Well constructed sentences, and decent plot lines. Solid characters, credible action. It may be fiction, but other than Science fiction, I want mine to read as credible."
Very Negative,I Love Mara Wilson she is cute and beautiful.I also loved her in Matilda. I think that Matilda was beautiful.she is a good actress.she was a cute girl in Mrs.Doubtfire.I think that she was very good at that part
Very Negative,"I ordered this clock. The first one sent to me did not work at all. The replacement worked until 4:40 and stopped. Every time I would reset it, it would tick until 4:40 and then stop. I can not recommend this at all. It's too bad because the dinosaur matched my sons room theme really well."
Negative,"Home for Christmas. Sounds innocent enough. But you would be well advised to stay away from this home. It is a horrible place. You'll be asking Santa for some ear plugs if you purchase this cd. Alternately, you can buy it for people on your Christmas list that you don't like or just plain hate. How bad is it? Some say that the CIA used it to torture hardened terrorist suspects in Guantanamo. It had them babbling like babies in minutes. But if you are a fan of Kenneth Copeland, go ahead and buy it if you must. After all, the man has a private jet and he's gotta pay for that jet fuel somehow!"
Negative,"Only about 1 hour long, and most of this is talking. Somewhat interesting, but I wanted Dolby Digital Hendrix!"
Neutral,"The DVD was very interesting but for one glaring problem. The creator fails most of time to tell the viewer whos speaking in the interviews. For the Jimi fan who doesn't know everyone that Jimi interacted w/ by face, this is very frustrating. Other than that it had some nice clean footage.I had much more fun watching the Jimi Hendrix Story DVD...BR>Even though it is presented in Mono."
Positive,"While not nearly as engaging as Exterminator! or Naked Lunch, this shows an epic quality to his style and a tie-in centered around some ancient myth of the time before time, (when the world was advanced enough to cause its own demise) and using it as plot points for the strange tales evoked; from guerilla uprisings to life as it once was, to the pandemonium of the future. Fantastic introduction, calling on mythical demons and whatnot. Recollecting the events is, of course, foggy and chopped into so many fragments of absolute brilliance in hindsight; however not quite on top of his game."
Very Positive,This was such a great book. I loved it. It was beyond sweet. I love Quinn. I wish I could meet a guy like him. L.J Smith is the best author in the world. I have read everyone of her books and they all are Da Bomb.
Very Positive,"I can read these books over and over, but especially this one. It's my favourite. I started reading them over two years ago, and I still like them, whereas other books I have grown out of. There was something about Rashel and Quinn that I really liked though. I hope she writes more, and I wish they were easier to find! ............"
Neutral,"Even though I knew the recording would be in old style,I was surprised at the poor quality of the CDThe service from the company sending the CD was outstanding.So 2 stars for the CD and 5 stars for the service.JimO."
Positive,"My daughters love this puzzle. We've had it over a year, and it's still in good shape. Nothing peeling or splitting, just some chew marks from my younger daughter. What's more, they still pull it out to play with after all this time. My only problem is that there is no picture of the puzzle on the front of the assembling board, only a small picture of it on the back. I'm used to doing puzzles where I have a picture to guide me. But my daughters have learned to put it together by matching similar colors or shapes, which is a good educational value too. For the price, I highly recommend it, even without the picture."
Neutral,"Madonna sounds amazing. Her voice is expressive and has awesome power and range. She easily carries the soundtrack. The other leads, Antonio Banderas & Johnathan Pryce are excellent as well. The reason this CD gets only 3 stars is because as great as the vocals are and as nice as the production values are; it still sounds like a 70's bloated rock opera! On screen this is a good thing. The overwraught melodrama adds to the grandeur and scope of the film, but, doesn't work as stand alone music. The exception is the new ballad ""you must love me"" which is passionate and heartbreaking in it's simplicity. BTW: Don't get this if you're looking for the radio version of ""don't cry for me Argentina"". That's a remix and available on the cd-single; not here."
Neutral,The CD isn't bad except that a lot of the songs are over played. Madonna does a great job of singing as always. I was surprised that Antonio Bandaras could sing so beautifully.

Very Positive,Madonna is the best singer on this cd. Her singing and voice is so angelic. The rest of the cast is superb.
Very Negative,"After returning the first version of this product because of constant paper jams, the replacement would not recognize the printer drivers from the first or allow me to replace them. In trying to overcome this through HP's support line, the recorded message said I would be directed to a representative and then promptly cut off the call (twice). Returned that version also."
Positive,"I do like the book and use it alot for school. The part that I use most is the Directory of Words Cited. Unfortunately, many times the exact type of work to be cited is not listed. For instance, a book with an editor in multiple volumes in an edition other than the first is not covered. Neither is an article from a journal obtained from a database."
Positive,"The bed is fairly comfortable and very convenient with the air pump already build in. After some time, it does lose air, but overall it is a good bed for the price."
Negative,"Guess I knew we were gambling when we bought this, since about half the existing reviews said it arrived with a leak. Remind me to never to go Vegas, right? It arrived, we blew it up with the built-in pump, which worked like a charm. Seemed like it was pretty comfortable... then my son took it on a sleepover, and woke up the next morning flat on the floor. Returned it to Amazon as a defective item for a full refund. Thinking I like another reviewer's idea of just buying a regular twin-size mattress, since we would usually be using it at home anyway, then maybe get one of the pump-less airbeds for the occasional road trip, since those have better reliability stats than the ones with the built-in pump. Live and learn..."
Very Negative,I bought this for my 9 year old to sleep on. We used it the first time and everything was fine. Pulled it out a month later and it has a slow leak somewhere that I can't find to repair. Basically a waste of $35. I guess you get what you pay for.
Very Negative,"I had to try sleeping on it the first night - in a couple of hours it was less firm, which made it difficult to roll around on. It didn't take long to realize that buying this bed was a mistake.Returning it will be very difficult because it is almost impossible to fit it back in its original carton (because one cannot evacuate all of the residual air necessary to make it fold up small enough). Prospective buyers should be mindful of this."
Neutral,"I bought this mattress to have as an option for when guests visit from out of town. I tried it out right away to make sure it didn't have holes, etc. I pumped up the mattress until it was firm, but noticed that the firmness went away pretty quickly--no one was laying or sitting on it, it was just standing alone yet losing firmness. There weren't even any sheets or blankets on it. I thought maybe I hadn't pumped the mattress up enough, so I filled it with more air. Same problem. I deflated the mattress and tried again the following day. Same issue. It's just not worth having an okay air mattress when I have had pretty great air mattresses (unfortunately the one I loved is being borrowed indefinitely by a family member and I can no longer find it in stores). I'm returning this and continuing my search."
Very Negative,I bought this for my four year old he in between beds and wanted something temp since we are planning to move to another state and didn't want to by a bed we would have to move so decided to by this. within a week had a first hole patch everything fine two week later another leak think it coming from where the motor is..we had a queen size on from same brand it that happen to that one as well. The one without the built in motor never had an issue with which is what we are using now. I also don't like the top it not comfortable with the humps.
Positive,I bought this air mattress because I was going to be having several different visitors in the next couple months. I've asked every person who has stayed with me if the mattress was comfortable and they all said that they got good night sleeps. It is also so quick and easy to inflate and deflate. The only question is trying to get the mattress back in the bag for storage. All in all for the money it was def. worth it and I'm glad I purchased them.
Negative,"Everyone who slept on this mattress, ended up with a jumble of bedding after a few tosses and turns. I would not recommend it."
Very Positive,We always have lots of grandchildren around and they are getting older so this bed comes in handy. Because it is raised up it is easier for me to put sheets on. So glad I tried it.
Positive,it is very good in cleaning but the drain pipe is not made of good material in the sense that you can't fold it well so it will give problem as water spread everywhere otherwise it cleaned the clothes very well.
Very Positive,I love this airbed! It is so easy to inflate and deflate! We bought it for my 6 year old for sleep overs and works great. We are going to take it on vacation with us so we don't have to rent a cot.It is very comfy and soft with it's velour cover. I would recommend it to anyone!
Positive,I was unsure what size to buy so I bought this twin size bed and then a queen size bed. The twin size (THIS BED) sets up quickly and FIRM! Whereas the queen size bed id more burdensome in size and labor. I recommend this twin size bed by Intex model.
Neutral,It is good except that it leaks a small amount of air overnight. The leak is small enough that you can make ith through the night.
Negative,"I have purchased two of these air mattresses. When inflated, they are great. But, during the night, they slowing deflate. I have yet to discover how to keep these mattresses inflated for eight full hours. I wish I would have bought a different air mattress."
Very Negative,This bed sucks after 1 month I was asleep on the bed when a popping noise woke me up I didn't know what it was so I went back to sleep when again a popping noise woke me up again I couldn't figure out what it was when I got up the following morning I noticed a big bubble going down one side of the bed that's when I realized it was the bed making the popping noise smh
Very Positive,"Funciono sin ningun inconveniente de acuerdo a lo informado en las caracteristicas.Recomiedo el mismo a todo el que necesite un colchon inflabe comodo y de rapido armado.Muy bueno el sistema de bomba de aire incorporado al mismo elemento, no esnecesario nada mas para utilizarlo."
Negative,"THIS IS THE THIRD MATTRESS IN 5 OR 6 WEEKS AND HAD THE SAME PROBLEM WITH ALL THREE. THEY ALL LEAKED RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING, SOME WORSE THEN THE OTHERS. THE BUILT IN PUMP WORKED GREAT AND I LIKED IT VERY MUCH. THUS THE 2 STARS INSTEAD OF ONE STAR. I AM VERY THANKFUL FOR AMAZON'S GREAT RETURN POLICY. IT WAS REALLY A PLEASURE TO DEAL WITH THEM."
Negative,"I purchased this a couple weeks ago, and used it for the first time last night. It worked well. Plugged it in and it only took a couple min to inflate. My problem with this bed is not so much how well it works inflating but what a hard time i had deflating it this morning. I was so frustrated trying to get all the air out that i finally just wrapped it up. With even a little air still in it, it makes it so hard to roll up tightly and put away. It just looks bulky. I have tried aerobeds in the past and i love that their beds have a release valve, this one uses the a small hole built in with the pump. The release valve work much better, and I decided to go with this because it was affordable and i couldn't find aerobeds in twin size. I am definitely gonna see if i can get a return on this... i just hope i can fit it back in the box it came in."
Negative,"I saw several people had written about air leaks but at that point the majority appeared to be happy with their purchase. We ordered two twins for our camp. Mine started leaking immediately. My husbands seemed to be good from Spring to nearly Winter when his too began to leak, so bad that both of us were pumping air several times during the night to keep a little bit afloat. That was bad enough but having several friends and family in our bunk house part of the camp awake while doing this pushed it over the edge. My father in law bought the same time my husbands started going down hill so it should be interesting to see if it happens again. Our camp closes down during Winter so Spring will be the big test. I suspect we will go with something a little more expensive and not regret wasting the money we did on these. Then again my hubby is very good at fixing things so maybe there's hope."
Negative,"The bed needs air refilling more often than I thought it would- every 3 days at the most. So much so that if I didn't pump it, the bed would all be like a water bed with ""jelly-like"" feeling. To lessen this effect I situated it in a corner of the room against the walls. Further more, what surprised me was the round water condensation on the bed sheet just underneath my (head) pillow in the morning. But what confuses me is that in the evening the bed feels cold (or the air inside feels cold).What I like about it though is that the pump works real fast in inflating- although it is loud for an evening activity."
Positive,This was great for our recent vacation to the snowBoth my daughters brought their beds and were quite comfortable the entire tripEasy to blow up but not easy to get back into the travel bagI rated it 4 stars for this reason
Very Negative,"I bought this mattress as a spare guest bed for our vacation condo. I was delighted to see it described as being 80""x40""(a twinXL). It arrived and the box clearly stated 80x40 dimensions so put it in the closet for future use. Just pulled it out of the closet 3months late and inflated the mattress only to find it is a standard twin measuring 32""x72"". Nothing close to the stated dimensions noted in the product description and on the box."
Very Positive,"The day before my guest arrived, I opened the box, took out the bed, plugged it in and it was inflated in less than three minutes. My guest slept on it for a week and I never had to add air. He said he was very comfortable and that he would buy one for his apartment to use for his guests."
Positive,This bed works perfectly for me. I have a lot of family members who visit for the weekend and it is easy to set up and very comfortable.
Negative,"I bought this airbed on October 2009, I only used it 3 times and now is loosing air!! How can it loose air like that with only 3 uses?? At the beginning it seams good because is comfortable and tall, but now I can't use it anymore unless I want fill it with air at the middle of the night."
Positive,"I bought this to keep under the bed in my toddlers room. Was packaged great, blew up fast..less than three minutes and wasn't a problem to deflate either. The bed itself is ok, I wouldn't say COMFY because it is an air mattress and in't meant for long term use, but as far as air beds go.. this one is nice."
Negative,"I was so excited when I received this air bed, but after sleeping on it on the first night, things changed. Every single night I had to put more air in it in order to keep it firm. There were no leaks that I could hear, but it was a pain to keep putting air in it every night. If this does not bother you, the bed itself is extrmeley comfortable.Intex Pillow Rest Queen Airbed with Built-in Electric Pump"
Very Negative,"This entire album sounds like it was rather cheaply recorded via nothing but sequencing on keyboards that really don't sound that great anyway.It reminds me of those keyboards you used to buy where you could push one key and it would play a song for you.I really don't understand why he released this. I've been a Nez fan for years, but this one left me feeling quite ripped off.I feel he's taking his fans for gullible idiots with this half hearted attempt at an album; thinking we'll buy anything he puts out."
Very Positive,"This is one of those movies that I didn't want to end. It is that good. Seeing Robbie, Levon, Rick, and Garth look back at this album, and talk in depth about the making of it, was pure heaven. Seeing the joy on Levon's face when talking about Garth's playing put a smile on my face. I'm not waxing poetic here, folks. If you love the Band, do yourself a favor and get this DVD."
Very Negative,"This thing smells SO gross, like harsh, toxic chemicals, that I can't even use it! I've washed it in HOT, super soapy water, cleaned it with alcohol, and even let it ""air out,"" all to no avail. I tried using it and the smell was seriously distracting. I took it out of my drawer, after all the washing, to show it to my boyfriend and while i was still a good four feet away he said, ""Ewww, what's that smell."" I found it to be WAY too large, too, and I've had kids. Sadly, this will be going in the garbage."
Negative,"I thought this would be good to try because I love the floating beads in the other rabbit vibes. I am a single gal, solo practitioner so to speak, and found that the steel rotating balls are just not comfortable for me. They are too hard with no give and get quickly uncomfortable especially if you squeeze your muscles. I can usually have one orgasm with this toy but not the multiple orgasms with the more comfortable rabbit vibes with the pearl beads. It's okay but it just doesn't get the job done for me."
Very Negative,"When I ordered this item, I was not aware that it could not be returned if defective. The item arrived very timely, but it would not operate. I later found out that the product is nonreturnable. I was very dissatisfied with this purchase."
Very Negative,"I received this item and it;s dead!Doesn't work and I cannot return it. wasted $40 bucks..I'm so angry, I bought this as a gag gift for my friend for a party and now i'm out money...Very disappointing..."
Neutral,"I didn't expect this item to be so LARGE, and the vibrations are not as strong as I had hoped. Although, the overall quality is terrific. It's very jelly-like, and it's unlikely to break at all because the beads are metal and not just thrown in there. I still haven't been able to use it yet because it's sooooo thick, I'm hoping I'll be able to with some help from my fiancee."
Negative,Got this product and used it but it doesn't get me to the big O. It's just to stiff for me and also the rabbit ears don't reach the right place. All i have to say it's just wasn't for me. I wish i didn't buy it.
Negative,First time buying a toy of this type. Great orgazm but then the buttons stopped working and the devise would not increase in speed or intensity and nor wood it shut off. No wat to return it on Amazon due to policy
Very Negative,"I ordered this after my other rabbit quit working. Thought this one was affordable. Very Very cheaply made and not much power. Smells very bad, so much you could hardly stand to be in the same room as it, let alone use it. If you are going to buy a rabbit do not buy this one. Invest in one a little nicer."
Negative,"Purchased online, good description with size included. However, when it arrived it was larger than advertised (length and circumference). It was actually to large and caused some discomfort. It has a very hard plasltic like feeling which did not help with insertion. It seems to be well built if you are looking for the terminator of vibrators!! If you have had a few kids and need something bigger and harded, this is for you! For us it was a waste of the money spent as we will not be using it again."
Very Positive,You're an idiot if you don't buy this. I lasted maybe 30 seconds. Better than any boyfriend I've ever had- hello new best friend
Very Negative,"I was excited to try this vibrator at first because of the addition of the beads. I was really disappointed in this product however. It's awkward to handle, using it and trying to use the buttons at the same time takes away from the focus on the sensations. The beads are far from pleasure enhancing, they felt awkward and sometimes pinch a bit if you change the direction during use. They are also bulky and and uncomfortable. The plastic is smooth on the outside which isn't necessarily a bad thing but I personally prefer some texture, it's also really thin where the beads are, which I suppose is to allow sensation but considering I didn't like the way the beads felt... I would've preferred thicker plastic."
Neutral,"unbelievably HUGE. like crazy thick. scary. This is only good for when you're very ..ehem... ""ready for it"".beware. I don't recommend starting off with this... it was actually painful."
Negative,"While I LOVE the jack rabbit feature, the vibrator is overall too big for me to use. I can sort slip it inside but its tight and not very comfortable. Maybe because its too big, I cannot feel the beads at all, I don't think they have any room to move. The vibrator is also quite heavy. It would be perfect if it were more slender. So girls who are not very big down there might not want to buy this product."
Very Positive,My wife was scared to use this when I took it out and showed it to her but now she loves it. We play with it about 5 times a week
Very Negative,"I never actually got to use this product, when it arrived the bottom of the battery pack thingy was missing and when I attempted contacted the California Exotics customer service via both email and phone call I never received a response."
Neutral,"While the first general sensation is pleasing, the batteries dont last very long and the vibrations and twisting beads aren't strong enough."
Positive,Now this one is amazing. My husband and I were enjoying ourselves tonight and he used this on me and I absolutely LOST IT. It was amazing omg I screamed like haven't in along time. It made me feel so good lol. LOVE IT!!!!!!
Positive,The product came quickly and discretely. The vibrator is very strong with three settings. I would just caution that shaft portion is fairly thick and may caused discomfort if not use to the size.
Very Negative,"This is one of the worst one i ever bought. The price is kind of high so i expected it to have some use. There is no vibrating motion beside the rabbit head. Since this product can not be return, I used it once and went righ in the trash."
Very Positive,"I bought this vibe about a month ago. IT is Fantastic! the best $20 I have ever spent, worth 2x the price.-Yes, it smells like plastic, I dont know why people are turned off by that. Its a vibe...made out of plastic.--The vibration is great, the perfect amount. there are two buttons, one controls the bunny ears the other controls the rotation of the shaft. Personally, I dont use the rotation often but the bunny ears bullet is wonderful. They do not irritate me however, I can see why some would complain if they have very sensitive skin.came in working order, and have had no problems since.takes 3 AA batsI recommend to all my friends!"
Very Positive,For me its a perfect fit and takes me to jus the right places!! N I luv the waterproof component!!!
Very Negative,"It's way too big for me. I bought it several months ago, and have used it maybe 3 times. It's uncomfortable. Also, the picture is MISLEADING! Inspecting it closer now, I see the little nubby on the pink jack rabbit, but it says nothing about there being several rows of hard, plastic nubbies near the head of the toy. Sad I wasted my money on this product."
Very Positive,"This product works for me. I'm a first time buyer and am pretty happy with my purchase! I read a few reviews complaining about how much noise the product makes but its really not too bad. If you have a fan or a TV on you're good. Also others were complaining about the smell, but its only noticeable if you put your nose right up on the device."
Very Negative,"This DVD contains discussions of the songs on Fleetwood Mac's Rumours Album, but not the songs themselves. They tell you about the song, how it was produced, what was going on and then they don't play it. If you are lucky they show about a 10 second video clip. It would not have cost the powers-to-be a dime to show a video of each song after it was discussed. In my opinion this ""Album"" is a tribute to arrogance. I will be sending it back."
Very Positive,"Upon intial inspection, the average listener will think this is yet another classics cd with nothing fresh going on.First and foremost, Glenn has been a highly underrated singer. All his career we know he was in the background, you always marveled at his vocal acuity, yet somehow he just couldn't seem to ""get over.""Notwithstanding, this is a beaaaaaaaaautiful cd. Glenn indeed breathes new life in some timeless classics. He even tightened up ""Show & Tell"" a song, I wasn't that crazy about when first released but this is yet a perfect example of Glenn breathing freshness into some wonderful R&B; classics. Kudos goes to his female partner on 'Where is the Love"" and ""My First Love."" These guys are saaaaangin' ya'll, okay?I really feel good about giving a guy who has been out there in the trenches for quite a while his flowers now. He has managed to present a wonderful project that he can be proud of and that you will enjoy for years to come!"
Very Positive,Brio is the most durabile wooden train set on the market. It has outstanding durability and quality. No other manufacterer on the market can compare. These are a must for any train set. It allows the child to build entrances and exits to his/her train roadway. Excellent.
Positive,I love this printer - my only complaint is that it shoots the paper out - you would think they could have a decent paper trayinstead of shooting my still damp photos across the room.
Negative,"My friend just brought a Epson c820 and it print better photosthan my HP 1115. I paid ~$[money] and he paid only ~$[money] from costco.So, I brought one myself. Epson print better photo than HP 1115.If you think of buying this printer, try Epson first.Also, the driver of HP 1115 doesn't work with my Iomega CR-RW andmy new Epson printer together. Bad software driver!!!"
Negative,"I have used this printer for the last two years, though it has not been heavily used. It has completely broken down, will not acknowledge that it has paper, and the ""carriage"" is broken. It will not feed anything through and constantly has paper jams. I have been told by repair specialists that it will cost several hundred dollars to fix it because the ""carriage"" is so expensive. Though it does print beautiful photos, I am very disappointed with this product's performance over time!"
Very Positive,"I purchased this flush mount,and they look much better than pictured.the base are metal and the color are antique brass finish.the design on the metal base is matching the design on the lampshade.I am very pleased with this lamp and it took me no time to assembled it."
Very Negative,"when i opened the box, i was expecting two elephant charms. what did i get? one. come on. who would buy one?"
Very Negative,"Bought this for my 5 year old Justice Leaguer. My son is not a rough player but we went through 4 (YES, FOUR) of them before we finally got one where the elevator didn't break in the 1st 2 weeks. Mattel needs to get their act together and design toys that have durability. VERY disappointing!"
Very Negative,"We bought this for our 5 year old for Christmas. The elevator uses a string pulley which promptly bound around the gear that connects it to the thumbwheel which raises and lowers the platform. Within 5 minutes of playing, one of the main features broke. Also, the top has a ring with 5 rockets, one of these came missing a retaining pin. Thoroughly disappoingting as he is a big Justice League fan."
Negative,This toy has peaces that fall off even while puting it together it kept falling apart the legs would not stay on and part of the tower would not stay together. I would not recomend this toy to anyone else or pay for it again myself.
Neutral,"Received VA912B was bad with text appearing as areas of light and dark contrast in bands down the screen which made text almost unreadable (also dead pixel mid-screen after a few days). Called Viewsonic support and they did the replacement policy where they send a new one and you return flawed one back in 10 days (their shipping expense). Monitor never arrived and I called back to find out it was out of stock. They agreed to send another model and it never arrived. I called back and they said they couldn't ship another model. So back and forth with numerous, long waits and calls and some very tense arguements. Received a new monitor after about 5 weeks and it was good. I am very pleased with all operational aspects of the 912. Display is very crisp, clear, and fast but was sure painful and long process to get to this point."
Negative,I've had this ViewSonic model for a little over a year. It has been good to be until now. I have been losing pixels every week for the past month. I'm out 25-30 pixels. Aren't products suppose to last longer then this?
Neutral,"Three friends share a monthly ritual of meeting for cocktails. Each of the women, Maggie, Roxanne, and Candice, has her own trauma to deal with, one that threatens to topple her into an abyss of despair. Maggie is coping with new motherhood and the associated depressing parts of it. Roxanne is the other woman for a married man, and Candice is paying for her father's mistakes, perhaps more than she bargained on doing. It only takes one malicious interloper to almost wreck the three's friendship and Candice's life, but when the women remember their friendship, nothing can stop them.*** Although the ending is almost too good to be true, the power of friendship is something that shines through clearly. Candice's story tends to be the dominant one, and is interesting enough to fill an entire book, but without Maggie and Roxanne's to be supportive, it would founder. ***Amanda Killgore"
Very Positive,"The book started out a bit slow as it built characters, but then becomes completely engulfing and such a fun escape into the characters lives that I didn't want the book to stop."
Very Positive,"This is unlike the other books that i have read so far. the plot revolves around a bar and three best friends. They are good at their jobs,articulate and know what they want from life. But a crazy flat-mate, an affair with a superior and motherhood corode their friendship and their lives-almost. This book is about true friendship and how it can get you through the day and lives problems big or small. A good read that cannot be put down."
Negative,"This book is formatted horribly for the Kindle! Never once was the word ""pleasure"" spelled out as one word. ""Plea sure""? Is that a British thing? Many many words where there were mysterious hyphens, words broken into syllables ""so ci a ble"" was one. Doesn't anyone proofread this stuff?Spoiler alert: As far as the book itself, I found the characters to be flat and two-dimensional. Maggie is drinking in a bar at 9 months of pregnancy? Candice despises her neighbor Ed until she has nobody else left in her life, then she's sleeping with him? Roxanne is a homewrecker who gets the home in the end? I dunno, it was really hard for me to want any of these women to succeed. It was like AbFab but without the humor."
Positive,"I really enjoyed this book. I must admit, that although Sophie Kinsella and Madeleine Wickham are the same author; I do prefer Kinsella over Wickham. However, this is still a great, worthwhile book! GOOD STUFF!"
Neutral,"This book was a really easy read.. however.. a little predictable.From the ""evil"" girl who plots against the other girls.. to the love interest. I don't want to have too many spoilers.Definitely a beach read but not a read if you're looking for anything deep and meaningful"
Very Positive,"I bought these as a gift for my daughter-in-law because she was complaining about the ones that are like earrings and were so hard to use. Her guests weren't using them! I had bought her some magnetic ones before, so got on line and searched and found these. She was so pleased and that pleased me. These are so easy to use and come in different designs.(golf, etc.)"
Very Negative,"Contrary to Dr. Eby's claim, Jesus did NOT return in his (Eby's) lifetime. FALSE PROPHET ALERT"
Neutral,"Service was prompt, got my book in a timely manner. Didn't expect book to be so old though."
Very Negative,This book's got coffee stain all over and in the poorest condition. Can't believe i paid 5 dollars for this crap
Positive,i do not understand this book but it was still good but I think I will get one with the easier version. I also think it was written four hundred years ago. So its still good.
Very Positive,Ordered this book since it was required reading for my freshman son. It was exactly what the teacher requested. Shipping was fast and book was in good shape. Thanks!
Very Positive,I was very pleased with the condition of this book. It contained no marks and seemed new!
Very Positive,The language of the book is really hard to read. I spent a lot of time before I finished the first Scene. But it is also enjoyable to read. Shakespeare did not write Romeo and Juliet. He just told story from Italian literature in his own words.
Negative,"We think that the book was a great influence to our English because it had a very difficult language so we had to look for the words all the time in the dictionary and that way we learn two things, to look up words in the dictionary and new words.We liked the end when all the main characters died. It left me a great message. If it wasn't for the video the school hired at the videoclub we hadn't understand it and the video is a bit boring also but we only liked it because Leonardo Di Caprio acted as Romeo in the video!"
Very Positive,"I won't summarize the plot, as it is one of the best-known tales in all literature, and deservedly so. Being a classic, it can be read from different perspectives and standpoints. For me, it is a study on passion, of instantaneous, immediate and eternal passion of love; absolute and without doubts; pure and immaculate. The lovers never have to discover the realities of living together. Their love stays in an absolute state of pureness. So, it is a vision of love in its most extreme state.Shakespeare's true genius can be observed in the fact that all of his plays, especially this one, can and have been adapted to a wide array of ages, places and circumstances. The story is universal because so is the passion it examines.The characters are unbelievably strong and accurate. The environment is wonderful Middle Ages Italy. The plot is twisted yet simple, and the Bard's sentences are pure poetry of the highest kind. No one should die without having read ""Romeo and Juliet""."
Positive,"If you're a Dolly Parton fan (even somewhat of a fan), this is a must have for your collection. It will NOT disappoint!!"
Very Negative,"It's definitely not having the cutting as shown on the model. I ordered size M as that's suggested on the the manufacturer's site for size 6. It's way too big. I exchanged it for size S. I have 36"" breast and 26"" waist and it's still way too big.The cutting is very bad as well. It's just a giant piece of flat cloth and they didn't have the shape for cups. Thus once you tie up at the back, you will have a weird surplus of fabric underneath your boobs. Very ill fitting."
Negative,"I decided to return this outfit because I did not have time to try and pin up the polka dot underskirt to make it look like the model's costume. The underskirt hangs 2-3 inches below the top layer making the outfit look frumpy. The underskirt is sewn onto some black fabric that can be tucked up around the waist, but it doesn't stay there (and it makes your waist look bunchy).The laces are cute but are a pain to tighten to get the outfit to mold to my body (reference, I bought an x-small since I'm 5'4"", weigh 104 lbs). Also, this outfit is extremely hard to take off, which makes a romantic night in rather difficult. Plus, I didn't want to have to put in bra cups to give me some curves up top. The cut of the top made me look flat (34B). I think this would work well for busty girls.The material of the costume is of the quality I expected for this type of thing. Overall it was cute--but it just looks so much better on the model."
Negative,"I bought this costume in hopes of wearing for Halloween ( last year). I had even separately purchased the duster ( which I am now using to really dust things). Uhh... I tried it on ( I got a X-Small) and its just big... the net piece ( part of the dress with the dots) go all the way down to almost my knees. Which makes it awkward and not sexy at all- its just weird I tried tucking the net part in to my undies to hold it, but it just becomes supper puffy- again looks weird. I never wore it and its still brand new sitting in my closet somewhere.Maybe its just for my body- I am not sure, but the material isn't as great either compared to the picture. Def. does not look anything close to how the model looks in it.Sorry- this was not a good buy at all. The model sure looks good in it."
Very Negative,"I find it very frustrating not to be able to choose my own color! If this practice was changed, I might order this product!"
Very Negative,"I'm glad I read the reviews! I agree, if I can't choose my color I don't want to order. There is another box, very similar (doesn't lock) where I can choose my color. That one I will order. Thanks for all YOUR reviews!"
Negative,"I wanted very much to get a blue one for my grand-daughter, but was afraid I'd end up with black. So......a lost sale for this company. Sorry!"
Positive,"'The most dangerous man alive'? Doubtful...more like an individual who proves how influential environment is on forming of human character. If you read this book and don't in some small way sympathize with the human being that is Charles Manson then you're less human than the 'monster' he is purported to be. Inevitably there is bias and self indulgent perspectives conveyed here; the writing is relatively average as well though it flows smoothly & does compel one to turn the page, even with droopy eyelids. At least it is an answer to the best seller written by the man who was most instrumental in putting Manson behind bars; at most it's as close to a confession the literary world will probably ever see from Mr. Manson."
Very Negative,"To label Charles Manson ""The Most Dangerous Man Alive"" is a farce. He is now a rambling senile idiot/inmate stored away at San Quentin. He is better known as a prolific liar than a prolific writer. This book well written, therefore it could not have come from his words or hands. Then again, he has always used others to do his bidding via murder or writing. Believe what you want but I believe it is pure horse manure, although entertaining."
Negative,"For all of you who are under the illusion that this book is in Charlie's own words, you're mistaken. At the time of the so called interviews, the author was not allowed any sort of writing utensils, tape recorders, etc. The words you see are those of the authors. Same old media hype to make a buck. The author betrayed Charlie by pretending to be his 'friend'. This is why Charlie declines so many interviews. Everybody distorts everything he has ever said. So my advice is: If you want to read the authors take on Charlie, buy it. If you want the TRUTH, don't buy it."
Positive,"Mike Connors was in the wrong place at the wrong time and now he is talking to Blue. Blue has something special to share with Mike, Blue is a serial kiler who is stalking the people of the small town where Mike lives. Blue wants to shre his thoughts and feelings with Mike, but Mike doesn't want to know. Mike is also making Blue angry - something that he really doesn't want to do. This gripping book will keep you glued to your seat from the opening scene to the spine tingling twist at the end of the story. An intense read that will leave you thinking long after you have turned the last page and closed the book."
Neutral,I now realize that I am not the only one who enjoyed the three books but I too felt that several chapters had been omitted.I was left with the distinct impression that the author decided he was tired of writing this last book and just quit. I would have had second and third thoughts about investing my time if I knew in advance that David was just going to up and quit on the series.
Very Negative,This book is an anthology of 3 books I had already read. I do not knowingly purchase anthol;ogies. O would not recomend this book unless yoy want all 3 books in one.
Very Positive,"If you are looking for sci-fi that deals with important, redeeming issues then keep moving. The 3 novels that comprise this series are pure space opera. That being said, the characters are engaging and sympathetic. I never dreamed that one of my favorite characters in a novel would actually be the Moon!My only complaint is that the story feels incomplete. I've been waiting for a 4th book that I fear will never arrive."
Very Positive,Empire From the Ashes tells a great story. This reprint worth buying if you don't already own the three paperback versions. Where's the fourth book? I've put it on my list of Weber books worth waiting for.
Very Positive,"Excellent newer release (2003) from Baen, but don't be fooled - this is the three book Dahak series released under a new title. It includes: Mutineer's Moon, The Armageddon Inheritance, and Heirs of Empire. This is not a fourth book in this entertaining series."
Very Positive,"I really don't know.Just finished re-reading it again, and still cried in parts, and was still left with a broad smile at the very end. (Like other readers, my paperback versions no longer have covers, and even this hardback is getting beaten up)The only disappointing part is that he isn't still writing in this universe.I asked him about it when I saw him at a convention in Denver a few years ago, and he said that this universe was pretty tied up at a good stopping point, and that he has so many other projects that he is less likely to go back to it. (I'm paraphasing).That is truly disappointing, because although I love most of his other books (I stopped reading Honor at about 12), this is his best work.Oh well...I only have to wait 5 more months for the next Merlin book."
Negative,"While the flexability is nice this uses non standard triple a batteries which is uncommon for most vibrators. Size is actually a little small and no twisting inside, I would recommend this to ladies who like it small or first timers."
Very Positive,"This CD single is smokin'!! The mixes are not offensive, but they are not as good as the widely listened to Radio Edit. They have a great record here...hands down!!"
Positive,"OBK is definitely the ""musica latina"" version of Depeche Mode (Speak&Spell time period). With haunting-dark vocals, basic bouncy beats and synthpop noise...you'll be sure to like it. There are a lot of wonderful artists/groups in the Latin Pop genre, but not too many go for the full electronic/synth sound. I give these ""dos hombres de Espana"" a lot of credit. Check out the band Moenia as well, if you like the Latin Electric sound!!"
Negative,"This book was very disapointing, and misleading. Like for example wing chun has no high kicks but you will see one in this book. enough said"
Negative,"I was very disappointed with the book because it touched on a lot of issues that we as black women deal with, but it never really addressed them. The title is very misleading and to me doesn't even really match with the storyline. I got the impression that maybe as she was finishing the book she got tired and kind didn't really put forth an effort to give the book a meaningful ending. I was very disappointed with the ending and thought it could have been much better. The rest of the storyline jumped around and the plot just didn't make a lot of sense at times - what one thing had to do with another wasn't clear. Like I said, the book touched on a lot of good issues, but provided no good resolution for the characters."
Very Negative,"This book is basically a bunch of recycled self help ideas tossed at the AA woman under the guise of a catchy title. I didn't make it half way and had to throw it down vowing not to crack the cover of that mess again. That book was rambling and was boring about the same old crap. Man problems, looks, and nothing about real feelings. It's just not my type of book. If you have just gotten out of a bad relationship like this one, then this book is for you. But for those who are not, move on down the cyber shelf!!I heard about this book on different AA hair discussion boards. Those who said it was great, I don't suppose you read much or you only read these types of books. This book is very sad and doesn't deserve the praise it gets."
Very Positive,"It is so good to see the vast African American talent that we have among us. Trisha Thomas has written a novel that a lot of us don't really tackle about. Our hair. She takes a real brave sister, Venus Johnston, who cuts off her hair, sends her boyfriend out of her life, and then embarks on one of her own. It is not all happy stuff here. Most of the folks she encounter are either trying to put her down,stalking her with crazy notes, and just plain being simple. Combined with the pressures of the corporate world and how she handles that, has the makings of a great debut novel. I feel the author wants to let us know that we are unique in our own way and don't need no one else to validate or tell us who we are. Brava!! or You go Girl!!!"
Negative,"If you like cute. It's okay, but you have to waid througha lot of syrupy, cloying, well, Canadianess. This stuffwould be great on Sesame Street."
Neutral,"I enjoyed this book, especially as it was on clearance. I didn't like some of the main character's motives, and some of the conflicts seemed manufactured, although I suppose I've never been rocketed away from home forever. I may read a few other of this author's books before I make a final decision on his quality. I suppose the most I can say is that this book left me ambivalent at best."
Negative,"I really enjoy the science in science fiction, and believable characters. I have watched the movie Aliens many times and I have always wondered why you would pick really stupid people to go into space. Is there going to be a shortage of smart people in the future? Are we going to rely on a bunch of idiots to take us into the far reaches of space? Is mister Renolds watching too many soap operas on TV?"
Very Positive,"this story is gripping in part because the 2 female protagonists honestly feel they are making the best decisions that will affect the whole crew. They are severely opposed to each others approach despite being close friends originally. The act of the captain to pursue the fleeing ""object"" and thus stranding here crew forever, inspires the entire human race to pursue a future in space and fulfill some aspect of a larger destiny. That this comet takes them to the end of time and space has its own amazing affect on the crew, there is a span of billions of years. This book is about responsibility and living up to it, including taking ownership for a vision and a mistake. great read"
Negative,"The album cover picture for this page is incorrect. See other offerings of ""Spanish Eyes"" by Paul McDermand for the correct image.The music is wonderful, however!!!!"
Negative,I liked the book. The mix of explanations of the painting and his life was very descriptive. I learned a lot about his friends and famliy. The book just reminds me that in every genius there's a lunatic.
Very Positive,This makes dull hair look fresh. It's not too much- it's perfect. I highly recommend it for those days when your hair can look somewhat dull- like in between coloring.
Negative,"I bought these at Target too. Yes, they are very big and take up a big space in the cupboard. The handles are terrible because there isn't really a handle on them. Yes, the rubber footing keeps them in place- when you can keep the rubber gasket to stay on. But if you want to hang on to the bowl like to mix up a pie crust, I have other bowls with a great big handle that's so much easier to grab and hand on to while working the dough. And if you want to use a hand mixer with 2 beaters in these bowls, forget it, they're too curved at the bottom. My other set of mixing bowls have a flatter bottom so I can use the hand mixer. There's just too much wrong with these bowls to get much use out of them."
Very Positive,"I truly love cooking with these bowls. The surface makes clean-up easy and the depth allows for me to throw an unlimited amount of concoctions into it. These bowls and strong and sturdy so that they will last forever and take all the wear and tear of cooking and the dishwasher. Overall, I'm very impressed with this product."
Very Negative,"I bought these. After two uses (the first being a french vanilla cake, and the second fudge brownies), they stained from the brownie batter and will not come clean. I figured these would be better quality, since they ARE kitchen aid."
Positive,"After receiving this as a bday gift for my 5 year old, I was worried after having read the reviews. However, I found that my kids are having a blast playing with the batcave. Its been a sturdy and reliable toy, and is definitly getting used. It has inspired more creative playing, too. It seems that only the batman/ justice league figures are able to use the elevator. Smaller teen titan figures got stuck and the door wouldn't open. Haven't had any problems of breakage, tipping or falling apart. So far, so good and the boys are happy!!!"
Very Positive,"This is the best toy ever! I was worried after reading the reviews. ""Falls apart, impossible to put together"" but I found this a great toy. I am 12 and I put this toy together in 10 minutes. It falls over? Well duh, you're supposed to set it up on a wall. Even if you don't you can put one of the bottom supports in front, the other in back. Seriously, this toy rocks. It's great because it does so much cool stuff. It has an elevator that changes Bruce Wayne to Batman. It has a zipline. It inspires more creative scenarios for play. A great buy!"
Negative,"My 3 yr old son wanted this batcave SO BADLY. We got it for him and it was pretty frustrating. The parts kept falling off and the elevator has NEVER worked. For 2 days straight he played with it, broke every piece off practically, and came crying to mommy to every few minutes. That was 6 months ago. He pretty much hasn't played with it since. Too bad because he's such a batman freak.Maybe he was just too young for it. If you're buying it for a younger child...beware!"
Very Negative,"This is the only thing my son wanted for Christmas. I was hesitant because I thought it was a bit pricy. But I didn't want to disappoint my son so I bought it. True, the look on his face was worth the money the toy was not. It took a really long time to put the thing together and it has to lean up against a wall to stand. When he uses any of the supposedly ""cool"" features another piece falls off. My son has a long attention span and can play with a toy for a half an hour before moving on to something else. This toy frustrates him after just a few minutes."
Very Negative,After spending the 30 minutes of my time putting together the hundreds of pieces and placing all the tiny stickers in the correct spots- it fell apart completely! Its a totally unusable toy. The cardboard background doesnt even fit in properly and my son has never touched it due to how unstable and flimsy it is. It is too tall to stand on its own and comes with something to adhere it to the wall! Dont waste your time and money on this horrible product!
Neutral,Does anyone know where I can purchase the action figures to compliment this toy? I have looked every where and can only find batman. The commercial and the box show many more figures to go along with the bat cave.
Very Negative,"I bought this batcave for the grandson for Christmas because the older model was no longer available. I was leery about the height of the toy and the bad reviews, and with good reason. Every time I turn around, there's a piece of it that has to be put back on. And I didn't realize until I read the other reviews that there is an elevator. Ours has never worked. My grandson likes the toy, but is getting bored with it, since it's always falling apart and quite a few of the gadgets don't really work. Don't buy this toy!!"
Very Negative,"My review title pretty much says it all.One sided books are fine if not disguised. This book has an agenda, anti Wal-Mart and pro union. Facts contained are presented with all the reasons one should be anti Wal-Mart and pro union. Many facts aren't fact, like the statement that Asda took over J Sainsbury's in 2003 - didn't happen.As the world's largest and most successful retailer there are many more interesting books about Wal-Mart. Fine if you're anti Wal-Mart or pro union.......but don't preach, make a book, let me decide!"
Very Negative,"the kit doesnt even fit the heater outlet vent on the 75K btu model. half the parts you wont need, just go to a hardware store & buy the ones you need for half the price."
Positive,"I have always loved Morcheeba and the way they do that coffee house sound, but this one takes it up an inch more, its very calming and awesome I recomend this to you if you are having a bad day and listing to music will make it better, this is a cd to put in your collection...."
Neutral,"Since I had a Visioneer One Touch already installed on my computer (The reason I bought this one is that the last one died. I got great service from the previous one.), I assumed the installation would go without a hitch. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. To date, I have been unsuccessful in installing the software and the scanner is sitting on my desk with my ""in box"" on top of it. I haven't had the time to sit on the phone, going through the long ""automated"" help menus.I haven't given up yet, but neither do I have a working scanner!"
Very Negative,"I loved the slim design and the USB power so I could power it with my notebook's USB port. The software was an upgrade to the other visioneer scanners I've owned over the years, which is easy to use. However after only a few hundred scans, there's a growing progressive distortion on the left side of images as if blackened, resulting in a very poor scan. I'm throwing it away. Buy something else."
Very Negative,"Vista has been out for 4 years, I'm up to Windows 7, and they still haven't released a driver update for this scanner!This is what's called planned obsolescence, where they intentionally make something not work so that you have to buy the new version. There's no reason or excuse for Visioneer not to release an update.This was the last scanner I'll ever buy from Visioneer. How can I have any confidence that they won't do the same thing with their new scanners when I upgrade computers again?"
Very Negative,"I was looking forward to a new scanner after my HP died after just a year. I purchased this one based on the several good reviews on Amazon and other sites.Now that I have the scanner I am sorely disappointed. The picture quality is horrible. No matter the tweaking I do in the scanner dialog, the picture is faded and grainy.The software itself is the least useful interface I've ever worked with. The ""auto"" buttons makes the image worse, the image area recognition has never yet gotten it right, and the most useful feature only applies if you are sending the scan to Paperport, something I never want to do."
Very Positive,"I read this book at the age of 14 (30 years ago) and will always be grateful to Rumer Godden for all she taught me about life. This novel, centered on the conflicts and misunderstandings between adults and children --- and their profound effects --- showed me that somewhere, there was an adult who remembered and understood the pain and confusion of adolescence."
Neutral,"Card installed very easily. USB 2.0 works perfectly, and this is why I bought this card, but firewire has been a little flakey. It works ok, but I have to unplug my drive and plug it back in, to get it to mount."
Very Negative,There are not enough color selections for the average person. The product seems to work but Coverblend needs to work on offering more color selections as women come in a variety of shades and skin tones.
Negative,"I really enjoyed the first 100 pages of King Rat and expected good things from the remaining chapters. But the novel goes downhill as the reader is forced to learn more about Peter Marlowe, a character I suspect we're supposed to admire for his complexity. The dialogue between prisoners is forced and the sub-plots are only of marginal interest. I found myself skimming the final third of the novel, as concentrating on it was much too painful.With a 4 and 1/2 star rating, a prospective reader would think they were buying ""The Brothers Karamazov"". Same goes for all of the books on Amazon that suffer from 'grade inflation'. With every novel commanding 4 or more stars, what's left to differentiate the great novels?"
Very Positive,"This book is, without a doubt, one of the quickest reads I've ever seen. Though about 300 pages long, one could realistically breeze through it in a day. Why? Because the story flows so well as to keep one engrossed. There's never a dull moment; it's always interesting, and the profiles of the main characters are excellent and poignant. Clavell's real-life experience as a prisoner at Changi really shows, as he masterfully captures the atmosphere, mood, and times of life in a prison camp.Highly recommended."
Very Positive,"Whether you are a fan of Clavell's Asian Saga or a casual reader, you will surely enjoy his first major book about prisoners of war at Changi in Sinapore during the Japanese occupation. Because Clavell himself spent time in the POW camp, he has a real perspective of what life was like in the camp. He is able to describe to the reader a sense of competitive community that the prisoners had amongst one another and that it seemed the Japanese hardly had a role at all. One enterprising character is able to make a great deal of money and garner a large amount of supplies at the envy of most others. The title itself has a cryptic meaning that only reading the book will dissolve...."
Very Negative,"after reading all of clavell's books, i was looking forward to King Rat. It made me uneasy. I was left with a very disatisfied feeling. Who rated this book so high? were they relatives?I do not recommend it."
Positive,"After reading Shogun I was hungry for anything written by Clavell and went on to read King Rat (which was also made into a movie that I found to be quite good). Clavell is a master of character development and as this is one of his earliest(if not earliest) works, one can see the greatness of this author who would go on to write at least one of the best books of our time (Shogun). This book which takes place in a Japanese prison camp located in Singapore Island during WW2 and it centers on one of the few Americans imprisoned among mainly British and Australian prisoners. The American thrives in this harsh environment and manages to possess more than anyone else and has a knack for making money. It is a character study about greed, friendship, war-time relationships and social hierarchy. It's a well written book and an interesting story that is remembered long after the book is read. I highly recommend it and would have given it 4 1/2 stars if allowed."
Neutral,"We usually love Melissa and Doug products in our household, particularly the puzzles, but this was a disappointment. This is advertised as a wooden puzzle so many people might assume it has wooden painted pieces like the chunky style puzzles. Not so!It has wooden pieces with glossy paper glued onto the pieces. One of the pieces of paper was peeling and had already came off the number six before we even removed this puzzle from the wrapping. Not worth the money and a huge disappointment coming from a company I've come to trust."
Neutral,It does exactly what it is suppose to do. The wood is cheap so expect some splintering and if a piece gets stepped on it will break. It is almost the like the wood of a Popsicle stick.
Neutral,the pictures are a little off. The puzzle is durable and has survived slobber. I would recommend it for someone trying to help their younger kids learn numbers/counting.
Positive,"As a beginner crocheter I found this, my first pattern book, a delight. It was hard to choose a pattern from the 52 stylish afghans available, all illustrated with beautiful coloured photos. However, the crochet instructions were a little difficult to follow for a non-American and chart diagrams would have been a useful alternative. As would the degree of difficulty involved. But after receiving some help in deciphering the instructions, and referring to the stitch guide at the back of the book, I was able to work my way through the pattern I chose."
Neutral,"Years after I read this book, I still remember the tale of the dying Building, its Owner and the Tenants. At the time I read it, I was working for a Landlord who also had trouble collecting the Rents and paying the expenses, just like in this book. Sadly, the theives and low-lifes who represented most of the building's tenants weren't that interesting to me. When the State took over the Building, things only got worse for it and the Tenants. This book was at times gross, at times funny and at times frighteningly realistic. Anyone who's ever managed (or tried to manage) slum buildings will recognize himself here. I? Well, I was just the computer guy, but working for that company scared me out of income property investments for life.I give this one three stars because I had difficulty getting through the gross passages. But the fact that I remember it over ten years after I read it must mean something, right?"
Negative,"I have tried several permutations and combinations with this scanner. Here are some of the observations:1) Image resolution is too bad for the file size it produces. I used an EPSON scanner before, and could get a much better B&W; and color resolutions for a much shorter file size2) All the images are titled towards one side. So, if you are scanning photographs, this is not the right scanner. A part of the picture will always need to be cut out if you try to straighten it up!3) When trying to get a reasonable B&W; resolution (300 dpi), scan speed is not as great as advertised.Overall, I don't think this scanner is worth its price."
Very Negative,"This scanner worked fine for me for a year, and now with later windows 2000 service patches, it has what appears to be USB problems. I've tried the latest driver available on several machines, and if they have windows 2000 with the newest patches, it will only work once or twice, then there is a driver error. I can do the normal windows recovery technicques of uninstalling & reinstalling, rebooting, trying different USB ports, etc. but short of re-imaging the machine, it won't recover. I am using this scanner with Adobe Acrobat 6 Pro with the latest service patches. I've researched and not found a new driver for this device for quite some time. Going to try to hack on a visioneer driver after reading some of the other reviews here."
Negative,"Firstly, it is incredibly important that you DO NOT use the bundled software for this scanner. The program is confusing and terribly disorganized. I have had several issues with using OmniPage, Readris, and Microsoft Scanning software bundled with Windows. While image quality is good, especially considering the speed of the ADF, the ADF gets jammed during almost every scan with these programs.I strongly recommend that if you have purchased this scanner, use Adobe Acrobat 6 or later. I am using 6.0 Professional and it works like a charm. The file size is extremely manageable (300K for 15 pages) and is quite readable.If you have not purchased this scanner, DON'T. While I don't have any recommendations for other models or brands, I will suggest strongly that you avoid this one. It has been quite an experience, causing me to use Kinko's and similar because I couldn't get this scanner to work. Since using Acrobat, most issues have been mitigated to a tolerable level."
Negative,"My Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB only worked for 6 months. I no longer have any sound and the battery doesn't charge. When I called customer service I was given the excuse that it wasn't supposed to be used in the gym. As you all know it is marketed to fulfill your portable music needs. If you can't use it in the gym then it is not truly portable. I know many people who use their ipods in the gym and have had no problems for years. This product has fallen far below my expectations. It is not worth the $300, not to mention the fact that it only has a 90 day warranty. Can you trust a product that is only guaranteed to work for 3 months? No."
Very Negative,"This product is the the first Mp3 Player that I bought and it has turned me off from buying anything from creative again. As others have mentioned the headphone jack breaks quite easily, but not from rough use, it just breaks down. I barely had this thing a month before it started giving problems, and I only used it to go from home to work. This I guess is why people flock to the Ipod, cause you may not be able to replace the battery but it is damn sturdy. This is just a piece of junk"
Negative,"I got the 40gb jukebox zen xtra for christmas. So, I've had it for a month, and the headphone jack went out. I called creative and they said to send it in and they would decide if it in warranty. It'll take 10-15 business days for them to decide form when they get it. Nothing but hassle with this company. What kind of product goes out within a month?"
Very Negative,"I took my zen back after a week of problems.It's really fussy about id3 tags, which is a problem if some of you collection didn't come _directly_ off cd. I fiddled around with various automated taggers, but never got things working to satisfaction. The player crashes every 3 to 8 hours of operation and frequently takes 20+ minutes rebuilding it's database of tracks after a crash (i hear this process is made long by incomplete id3 tags).Two days ago the left headphone channel started cutting out, as it has for many other reviewers. That was the last straw. I'm over it, thinking about a rio Karma or nothing at all."
Neutral,"The man's name is Ron Goodwin for heaven's sake (not Roy). He is one of the most popular light classical (some would say very light) composers of the 20th century. Earnslaw is the one I was looking for, just fantastic. The rest is OK, in fact mostly better than that, but not very demanding."
Very Positive,"This is a great reference book, especially for beginners. Contains tips that experienced anglers will find very useful. Though no one book will have all the answers one seeks, this one helped with a good chunk of mine. A must have and a steal for the price."
Very Positive,When somthing is worthy of remembering bought and shared with my kids. These kind of books will always be a gift for all their lives.
Very Positive,This is the best Christmas music I have ever heard! Very hip finger-snappin' funky swinging tunes! Perfect music for your holiday gatherings! Sound quality is very good! This album was originally released in 1961 and it remained on the top Christmas LP charts throughout most of the 60's.
Neutral,"This book started out as a nice snapshot of the characters in New Orleans. About halfway in, it devolved into a sociology disseration on the racial/class ills of the city. I grew up there and am well aware of the problems. Some of the ideas put forth by the author were simplistic at best. Otherwise, a pretty good book."
Neutral,"Although I have read many books on slavery, this one was a little different. The first couple chapters were similar to other slave stories, but it took a different turn after that. The setting and circumstances made for an interestingly different story."
Neutral,"3 1/2Intimate club sit-in with Duke and his big band crew does succeed at giving enthusiasts a well recorded live experience featuring his spectacular arrangements, however with the onslaught of grunts and groans, and some of the highest horn squeals this side of Zorn, this swingin' time is not without a share of piercing indulgences, not the least is how every track requires the swanky introduction from our conductor."
Neutral,"I bought this CD player because it was reasonably priced but I probably would have been better off buying a portable cd player with am/fm raido with a headphone jack. When I left the anti-skip protection off, it skips at the slightest move. I also found that if I turned the anti-skip protection on, the sound quality isn't as good."
Neutral,"I was hooked into this game for about a week and then beat it. It has a career mode where you start out with a few players and try to beat top teams in various cities, adding their best player when you do beat them. If you have played an NBA Street game before, you probably know the style of the game. For those who haven't played NBA Street, the game is played by ones to 21. There are also trick points where if you get a certain amout you get a gamebreaker. If you score a basket during a gamebreaker, it gives you points but also subtracts points from the opponent. This game has no online, poor graphics and limited minigames, three very big cons for me. I would recommend buying NBA Live 2006, which has online and franchise, but I don't own it yet."
Very Negative,"...I've seen too much damage come out of the trumped-up ritual abuse hysteria of the '80s/'90s. Thank God (yes, I'm a Christian), that this mostly-imagined phenomenon is no longer ""happening."" This book, while well-intentioned, is not based in reality."
Very Negative,"I was very eager to see a video of this outstanding woman, but I was very unhappy with the product. Dull. Two other items included on the video, but the part about Wells consisted of a person reading from a book. Get the book biography instead of this product--a waste of money."
Negative,It turns out that this book only comes with Audio cds! Go figure: When the TOELF is mainly take on the CBT form
Positive,"If you know English well and you need only to review some important details, this is the book you need to buy. It covers small rules, which are VERY IMPORTANT for the TOEFL, but it does not tell you much, for example, about sequence of tenses.In other words, this book will help you to improve your score, but it can not teach you English if you are a beginner.For me, the most important part of the book was structur review. IT really helped! Listening part shows the same level of difficulty as in the TOEFL, but reading is much easier then on the test. To understand the reading level of difficulty and to practise the test I would recommend TOEFL Test Preparation Kit."
Very Negative,"I couldn't even finish it. I kept reading it thinking, ""What is the point of this story?"" I found it very boring at times and disgusting at others. Definitely one of the worst books I've ever read."
Very Positive,"I read several reviews on this book already, and feel that what I have to say about this book has already been said. I loved this book, and found it to be quite the page turner."
Very Positive,"Once again, Bryanna has written a book that inspires everyone to eat well - by ""well"" I mean both healthfully and with gusto. Fantastic vegan fare."
Very Negative,"Me encanta leer libros de cocina y pense que este sería ""el libro"" para conocer arte y costumbres culinarias de otros paises. Como soy originario de México y ahora vivo en Brasil, lo primero que leí fue lo referente a estoa paises. QUE DECEPCIÓN!La idea del libro es excelente y seguramente la autora tuvo que viajar, leer y estudiar mucho, pero pienso que debió haber pedido ayuda a que revisaran sus capítulos personas conocedoras de cada país o región.Tiene muchos errores históricos, geográficos, culinarios y de ortografía del idioma original. Estoy preparando una lista de ellos que posteriormente enviaré.La felicito por su dedicación, perodes graciadamente el resultado no es del todo bueno.Hans Rio de Janeiro/Brasil"
Positive,"This is a product wich can give you satisfaction running your computer! I'ts much faster then other products and can sure you the 'light speed' in xomputers world. I'ts compatible with most desktop configuration's : home computer's, office computer's... This is a product for men wich need speed."
Very Negative,Bought this DVD on the strength of the tape I had of the same concert broadcast on Showtime in the 90's. Thought the concert should have won a Cable ACE award it was so good. Couldn't wait to see the DVD version and when I heard the first vocals come out I couldn't believe that they had overdubbed new vocals over the originals. What was one of the best concert videos that I had ever seen and heard was ruined by someone who thought he could improve on perfection. Don't waste your money if you've seen the original.
Very Positive,Whenever Tina Turner kicks off another world tour we know that one year later we can buy a great Live video!!! Live in Amsterdam is by far her best concert video ever! Tina Turner will start a new world tour early 2000...I can't wait to see her live again and by 2001 we will have another concert video as a fond reminder.
Very Positive,"Great DVD. If you are a Tina Turner fan, it's a must have."
Very Negative,I have read other Ivan Doig books and found them immensely interesting but the phrasing and vocabulary in this book were very awkward. The descriptions would have been better if the author had not tried to use big words which made the voice of the book seem pretentious. I read it for a book club and had a hard time getting through it. The sad thing is that the story itself was interesting as were the characters. It was just an awkward book to read. It definitely was not a page turner. I don't think I shall ever read anything else by Doig which is a disappointment after reading others.
Negative,"sure its a bit funny, and it touches me cause i am a swede, but it seriously is not that good of a book. its just about rough seamean looking out at the BRISK sunrise. big words don't make a book good.i did NOT like this book, but im giving it some sympathy points, which is why it gets 2 stars."
Neutral,Sansa is my fav but it always shuts down on me and after six months it just breaks. Not good long term project but very easy to use and a decent price.
Very Negative,IVE HAD TO SEND TWO OF THESE BACK NOW. THEY SHUT OFF AND WONT TURN BACK ON. THESE ARE DISCOUNTINUED AND I BELEIVE THE BATTERIES ARE SHOT IN THEM.I WOULDNT BUY ONE!!
Neutral,"I purchased this mp3 player for my son. We were both very pleased with its functionality, ease of use, and sleek look. Unfortunately, either the player itself or the cable that came with it was defective, causing power errors, and keeping us from charging the unit or transferring data."
Very Negative,"Got this about 6 weeks ago. One week into it, the device started getting ""stuck"" on rewind. It's supposed to stop rewinding when you release pressure on the wheel, which it still sometimes does successfully. About half the time, though, it gets stuck on rewind and the only thing I can do is turn it off, none of the other functions (like play or stop) work.Newer problem: it's supposed to skip to the next track when you hit the fast forward button twice. It did that in the beginning, now it usually doesn't, same thing with trying to go to a previous track.Either I got a lemon or this device is poor quality. This is my first MP3 player so I have no basis for comparison regarding battery life but it seems the battery drains very quickly."
Very Negative,"I hate this thing. It worked for about a month and that is it. It has driver problems. After 5 hours on the phone with Rhapsody, 2 hrs. with Sansa it still does not work. I have downloaded everything for this. It does not work. Waste of money, time. Very disappointed."
Negative,"Its just a durable product with great sound quality, but don't expect anything more from it. The ear phones are too big for my years and the device is not easy to use. You will need to use a software to convert your videos to be compatible with this device. The only good thing is that you don't need any software to load songs in to this player, however, the folders that you have on your hard disk will not appear on the player. This is what I don't like. I would like to have a player which will let me create my own music folders and not create the default ones. I disliked iPod because of iTunes, but now I feel iPod is much better than this even though iTunes is not so easy to use, its at least easier than running this device. No wonder, the product is priced so cheap."
Very Positive,This MP3 player is so nice compared to the iPod. All you have to do is click and drag the music on your computer to the MP3 player. No iTunes required. It is very nice. The capacity of 8GB is very nice too.
Neutral,"The Sansa View 8G MP3 player is a great sounding player but it stops working from time to time and then when using on an excersize machine you must stop and reset which takes a few seconds. After reading other reviews their must be some kind of flaw in this product.I've had this for about a month and their is a 90 day warranty so I am not yet worried. If it stops working after the warranty I,ll suck it up and buy a different brand."
Very Negative,"Whatever you do, avoid this product. I was lured by the lower price tag and as a group exercise instructor I needed something to lug all my music around on. I didn't want to lose my ipod (which I LOVE) so I got this instead.Well I've gone through two of them. You name the problem and I've had it. It has stopped working in the middle of a class I'm teaching, I've gotten the white screen of death, the display crapped out and for some reason it just stopped connecting to my computer. If I could give this zero stars I would. It will break if you look at it sideways.Sansa is replacing this for me, for the second time, but I'm going to buy another ipod instead because I just can't rely on this thing at all. I don't even think its worth giving to someone once the replacement gets here.DON'T BUY IT, YOU'LL REGRET IT!"
Very Negative,Worked fine... until the battery died after one year. You can't replace it so essentially the player is useless. Would not recommend.
Very Negative,"I purchased this less then one year ago, already the buttons are less responsive. The biggest problem that I have is that it does not play the songs correctly any more. I can hear the music and sometimes the back round singing but not the main singing. This started out as a periodic problem as I was running but now is almost all the time.I am very disappointed in this player."
Positive,"The player, itself, is great. You can drag and drop music easily without the need for another program. This is my 2nd one because the first one I bought (refurbished) constantly froze and the headphone jack began failing. If you want a big enough MP3 player for cheap, get this one, and buy some better headphones too."
Very Positive,This is a great product Be sure if you are getting a Sansa that it has the dial on the front. I have 3 sansa's and the only one I hate is the TOUCH Screen one. This one has so many great features and is so easy to use
Very Negative,"Review: I have had the sansa view 8gb for a year before the navightional wheel didnt work any more.(Make it fun! Who says you can't be informative and entertaining) I dont think so! im a person left musicless.( aawwww )Pros: the wheel lights up.Cons: the wheelConcluction: dont buy it!, dont !, wait one more time, DONT BUY IT !Recommendations: I personaly recommend buying an archos product, nuff said. :["
Very Negative,"My daughter received this item as a Christmas gift. About a month ago it just stopped working. We have had several emails and phone calls back and forth to the company, ""Creative"" is an accurate name for them...they are creative about honoring the 90 day warranty by putting you off until you are out of warranty. They have promised three times to email me the forms to have it fixed or replaced...and nothing yet. I emailed the company again today. They do not have a customer service number that is toll free, and I am about done running up my phone bill.We were happy with it for the first 60 days or so, but now, I will never buy another ""Creative"" product again, based on their customer service."
Very Negative,"After carefully opening the player, reading the entire instruction manual and following it to the letter, the player froze up. I can not accurately describe my anger. I bought this thing because reviews said it was the most customer friendly. If it didn't cost me $125, I would have run it over with my car. Do yourself a favor, avoid the Rhomba at all costs."
Very Negative,"read the reviews on the Internet the same way you are reading now. When I went to the store I have been misled by the salesman. He told me that the creative is a great brand and no one returned the product so far. He told me "" if it was a bad product creative would have taken it of the shelf by now"". I bought the product and it stop working after TWO DAYS"" not responding at all. I talked to the customer support and they ask me to send the product to them. It takes along..... time to get it back believe me I havent got the mine yet. Dealing with their customer support is hell. remember I warned you ""Dont buy this product"""
Neutral,"Looking for a biography of the former slave turned lecturer and abolitionist, I came across this work by author McFeely. The first section regarding the birth and circumstances of Douglass' flight to freedom was full of what I consider ""psychobabble"". The author makes too many conjectures concerning the relationship of Douglass with his owner, including possible latent homosexual feelings but never includes any information to back this claim up. The story picks up when Douglass moves to New England and becomes involved in the abolistionist causes. His travels to England and his relationship with women working for the cause of women's suffrage is particularly interesting. However, the remainder of the book seems to meander with no purpose.I am still searching for a biography which puts this man's life into context."
Very Negative,"I was so excited to see a new book on Frederick Douglass I didn't take time to preview the book. A classic mistake. The book is full of assumptions and innuendo. It seems the author was trying to destroy Frederick Douglass' place in history. There were too many insulting statements based on little or no fact. I tried to keep an open mind while reading the book, but the more I read the more disgusted I became. What the author may consider conservative and controversial; I consider a racist piece of trash."
Positive,"""The Old Grey Whistle Test Vol 1"" is the favorite music DVD in my collection. Volume II offers up more of the same type of intimate performances that this show was famous for. Unlike many shows of this nature, particularly those in the US, Whistle Test focused completely on the music. It was substance over style, though the dress favored by some of the acts looks hilarious now. Start with Volume 1 and then like me, you're going to want the second and third volumes. I hope there's more of these editions in the pipeline."
Very Positive,I am a single mom with two kids to feed and a boss that thinks I should work 50 hours a week just like the guys. This book lets me feed my family hot delicious meals no matter how late we get home or how much we have to do. And the recipes are so easy the kids can help. It is also great for those weeks when I do not have the kids and have to cook for one. I could pop in a Lean Cuisine or make pasta yet again but this book has many ideas more creative than that. It has reasonable portions for single servings and I can take any leftovers for lunch. It is a bargain.
Very Positive,"Why did I wait so long to get this book I had heard so much about??? It is fantastic - so quick, great recipes, great photography....and easy to make your dish look like the photo!"
Very Negative,"Sandra Lee has nerve calling what she does ""cooking."" Putting together a bunch of boxed ""ingredients"" and dumping them into different bowls is not ""cooking."" Too bad we aren't seeing professional chefs cut down Lee with the same ferocity they do with Rachael Ray.I get nauseous just thinking about the amount of sodium and everything else that's in all those bags of packaged food that she uses (and why all the mixed drinks? Maybe Lee can put together a show about how to make mixed drinks - alcoholic and non-alcoholic - because she seems to know all about them).To think she follows Ina Garten (who can actually cook) Monday-Thursday, is indicative of the fact that The Food Network doesn't have a whole lot of requirements as to who gets a show on their channel."
Positive,"With the holidays coming, I knew I would have even less time and even more to do than usual so when I saw this book I knew it was just what I needed. Some of the recipes are fairly basic, like the lasagna, but there are other more exotic dishes that I can't wait to try, the shangra la lobster being one. I tested some of the appetizer and dessert recipes for holiday parties and they were easy easy easy and looked and tasted amazing. This is a terrific resource for the holidays and all year."
Very Negative,The music plays just fine but the on screen picture is horrible. The picture is blurry and it looks like graphics form the 60's.
Very Positive,"Last year I found this book and once I opened it I could not put it down. Bugliosi is excellent at bringing the details to life on the page. Not only do we get a first hand account of the trial, but he also explains much of the legal process in very clear and understandable terminology. I am now a fan of his work and will be reading everything I can of his."
Positive,Bugliosi was without doubt a great prosecutor but the whole Helter Skelter theory as the motive over the years has become discredited in fact im not convinced Bugliosi if he tried the case today would use that idea again.
Very Positive,"I began reading the paper book. I found it so amazing that it was hard for me to leave it for my daily activities. So I went to the beach with the intention to finish reading it. unfortunately, night came and I had to pick my tings up. I forgot to get my book back, so I bougth the Kindle version, which has some advantages."
Neutral,"Let me just say that this is a great book, however buy the print edition. There is a list of illustrations in the Kindle edition, but I've yet to find an actual illustration. The FOOTNOTES are grouped together in the back. Not helpful in understanding California law and police procedures in the late 60s. I feel like I bought half a book.Again, read this book, it's great, but get it in print.Hey Amazon! If you had mentioned these things in the description, I could have made a better choice. Please, please make these things clear from the beginning. It's my first Kindle disappointment, so I'm not bitter, just sad."
Very Negative,"Vincent understands nothing about the intricate inner workings of the mind of Charles Manson. He totally misses the point. It would be nice if The Beatles were mystical figures from The Bible, and possesed god like powers to influence The Family towards committing any unpleasantness. Doesn't Vincent know that Charlie only listens to the music of Bing Crosby?"
Positive,"This was a very informative (and at times, scary) book on the Manson murders. It is written by the prosecutor of the case, Vincent Bugliosi. I had only very limited knowledge of the case so reading this book really gave me some futher insight. I am not sure how much ""new"" information this book may provide someone who is well versed in this case.The only reason that I gave this book 4 stars is simply because it did drag at certain times but as a whole, this is a very well written book!"
Negative,"This book is well written and highly detailed but it cannot be farther from the truth. Mr. Bugliosi's ""Helter Skelter's"" theory is just laugh out funny, plainly ridiculous. This is Bugliosi's story, not Charlie's. The biggest mistake you can make is buy bugliosi's story of the events and believe Charlie as the mastermind of the killings. But I won't lie, I couldn't put this book down. It would've been great if it were true, but it's not."
Neutral,"Although Mishima is one of my favorite authors I am having difficulty getting through this work, largely because of the terminology the translator has used. An otherwise excellent translation is marred by an appalling lack of understanding of Buddhism. Throughout the text on finds terms such as ""scripture"", ""priest"", ""parishioner"", and ""mass"" -- as if the subject were Roman Catholicism. This kind of metaphor reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the practice of Buddhism, which is annoying to this reader and would be misleading to others."
Positive,"This is a good book, but it does have some issues.If you happen to be looking at the Hardcover Import from 1994, there is an introduction from Donald Keene. In this introduction he pretty much gives all of the story away, including the final sentence of the book, and all the main events from the book. Luckily I caught on to this quickly and skipped most of the introduction, and read it after the story. This has happened in other books Ive read and I am unable to find a reason why these kinds of introductions are put at the beginning of the book.On a final note, the book can get slow and your eyes may start wander when the main character goes off on his long talks about his feelings and philosophical things, but if you can get past this, points will pop up in the book that keep you interested until the end. I recommend reading the book, and I will buy more books from this author."
Neutral,"This isn't my usual type of novel, and I probably will move on to other authors. An earlier reviewer commented on the similarities to Dostojevski, and in retrospect, I agree, especially when recalling a scene involving a non-Dostojevski book entitled nevertheless, ""Crime and Punishment"" near the end of the novel. The novel shares some similarities with that of FD. The book is serious and well written, and will have appeal to some readers. I recently toured Tokyo and the nearby temples at Kamakura. That trip enhanced this novel very much for me. I've much to learn about Japanese culture and Buddhism; reading this novel was an enjoyable step in that direction. That said, relative to my favorite tasty Western novels, for me, this represented a kind of bland oatmeal: it was sturdy and good, but somehow lacking. Another reviewer noted the Catholic projection of the translator onto elements of Buddhism; I too found this distracting in the translation."
Negative,I was surprised to see that the item was used. Advertised as new. Would have liked the new ones stead got used.
Negative,I got this book cuz I enjoyed the Philisopical strangler book. I found this book entirely too wordy. I enjoyed certain parts of the book. I burst out in laughter in a couple of places but it was too little. I could see what the authors were trying to do but it was not enuf.. I liked the strangler book.
Very Negative,"We purchased six of these heaters in February 2006, and by November 2006 only one was still working. One was DOA, two died within one week of arrival, and the other two died over the next seven months. We live in Southern California so these heaters were rarely used so its not like they wore out. Repeated calls to DeLonghi customer service went unanswered, and the local service company they refer to in their service manual is no longer in business. We are very disappointed with the heaters and DeLonghi and would not buy one from them again."
Very Negative,"I bought these for use on my ipod earbuds. I had an old pair (they were green) that worked great, but I lost one. Within minutes of putting them on the earbuds, they split open - all three pairs! If you're planning on using these for your ipod headphones, look into the older colored ones - I believe they're a different material and less prone to cracking."
Very Negative,"I have ear gels before, but none that were this cheap (and I don't mean cost!). There was no consistency in the size (they come in different sizes, but no two were the same). And without fail, every single one I tried to use split in half after being installed on the ear piece. Every one! It didn't seem to matter if they were small or larger -- or even larger than the ear piece. The material just began tearing from both sides and ended up falling off in ever instance.I am sure there must be a better quality version of these things somewhere. I seriously do not recommend these to anyone."
Positive,"I really like these. I like that there are 3 different sizes for each ear. I use the small ones and my husband uses the large ones. It was like they were made just for my ears. I would recommend these even for headphone, not just bluetooth headsets."
Very Negative,GOT THIS PRODUCT TO USE WITH A BLUETOOTH. NO INSTUCTIONS ON HOW TO FIT OR USE IT.SIZES DIDNT FIT MY EAR.
Neutral,"If you are planning to buy it, I can guess you have bought an ""extraordinary"" Jawbone. I don't know if Jabra and Jawbone are a society but it is the only one option you have to get the handsfree in your ear.I think there are several ways you can use this gel to keep your headphones comfortable in your ear, however it has to be perfectly round and inch of diameter and no more than five milimeters of depth.If you are planning to buy them because you are planning to use it with a ""wonderful"" Jawbone, please consider other market options for BT handsfree.However if you have a very unconfortable and little headphones or an already bought Jawbone, it would be your unique solution. But maybe you won't ever need it if you look for a better BT handsfree device."
Very Negative,"These are not the same that come on the earbud, and are not easy to use, or to hear from. I sent mine back!"
Very Negative,"Well I took a chance on these. I read previous reviews and believed what they said...Always go with your first instincts. I should have known better. They looked too big in the pictures, but the reviews made it sound like only a tiny part of these ear gels actually went in your ear. So I took a chance on them.I was so disappointed. They come with three sizes, however even the smallest size is much bigger than the ear bud on the Jabra bluetooth device, which was the initial problem. Don't believe previous reviews that tell you that these will solve the problem, they make it worse.I now have the newest, most expensive Jabra bluetooth device that will not stay in my ear. When it is in correctly it is very painful. I am now going to purchase the earbuds that I thought sounded good before I read the reviews. I will update then."
Negative,None of them actually fit my ear or the other person I brought them for. They were way too big. If you have small ears don't purchase this item.
Very Negative,"They look cheep and feel cheep and well.. they are cheep but they don't work which is the bottom line. Fitting them onto the jawbone does not lock into place so the ear piece you just spent over a 100bucks for falls out of your ear! It's not worth it since Jawbone gives you five ear buds that lock onto the Jawbone, which fit your snugly in your ear. They also give you a left ear or a right ear bar that lets you choose which works for you. So this product fails and had I'd seen them in person I wouldn't have spent my money on them."
Negative,"They feel better than the jawbone junk but there is no perfect fit even though they give you several different sizes. Then the jawbone bluetooth falls out of most of them.Basically, a waste of money unless you are one of the lucky ones that all fits as you had hoped."
Very Negative,produce is not compatable with the jawbone. design does not provide a snug fit to the bluetooth unit. a waste of money
Negative,"I have to say these earbuds do fit very snuggly in the ear and great a great feeling. Unfortunately I bought them for the jawbone 2. After about 3 weeks of using the same earbud on the jawbone, the earbud would not stay on the jawbone. It would constantly slip off the jawbone earphone and would not stay attached.I now use the jawbone without an earbud. It doesn't fit as nicely, but it stays in my ear now."
Negative,"I had high hopes for these to make my new Jawbone Era usable.Unfortunately, they are hard to fit, are not as flexible or form fitting as I had hoped and overall could stand to be much improved.Buy them if you have no other choice, but don't expect much or you'll be disappointed."
Negative,"I'm not sure what they *do* work with exactly (and it'd be nice if there was some clue in the product description), but they don't fit these headsets.EDITED TO ADD: Actually, I just discovered a ""wireful"" non-Bluetooth Jabra thing that I had purchased years ago and forgotten. It plugs into a phone's headset jack, and these earpieces fit that fine."
Very Negative,"I received these and they were defective. Months later, the company has continued to dodge me and still has not processed my refund. Their shipping costs are 6 times what it cost me to return them for no refund. Amazon, where are you to remove CMMA Accessories ? Don't let their 3 or 4 star overall rating fool you !"
Very Positive,"This movie was great! It combioned old Greek and Roman tales in today's special effects and Vwala! AWESOME! This tale is a romance about a man who leaves on a journey right after a new born son to go through the God of Athena right down to the underworld only to go back to his wife and live happily ever after, A WONDERFUL MOVIE! I recommend it to anyone who likes olden tales."
Positive,"I think The Odyssey by Homer is a pretty good movie. The cast members look like they lived in that time period. Some of the people that played in the movie are (Armand Assante) Odysseus, (Greta Sacchi) Penelope, (Isabella Rosselini) Athene, and many more. Also the clothes they wore were authentic. Like the tunic, all the dresses, and the armor. The casting by the actors made you think that you were watching the real thing. My favorite character in the movie is Michael Pollard who played Aeolus the god of wind. During the movie they started new adventures as soon as the finished one. The movie is pretty good but is slow in some parts. After a slow part it picked back up into an action scene. It is also more historical than entertainment. They had to press the wine, sacrifice goats, heard goats, fish, make weapons, and several other things. So in conclusion I give The Odyssey four stars"
Positive,"The movie the Odessey was a very very good movie. It was very well writen and acted out. I saw this movie during my History class at school. The actors did and axcellent job in acting out this movie. They made me feel like I was in the movie with them the whole time. My favorite god was Aeolus. He was very funny. Odysseus was played by Armand Assante. He was a very good actor. My favorite part in the whole movie is when Odysseus and Teemachus kill all of the kings that had come to marry Odysseus' wife, Penelope. The only thing wrong with the whole movie was the sexual content. There was no nudity but there were a few love seens. The special effects are awesome. But there are a few boring parts when the people were talking."
Neutral,"The movie ""The Odyssey"" was well done. It was much betterthan the movie Ulysses. The movie Ulysses didn't really tell EXACTLY what happened. But, However as a result The Odyssesy was FOUR to FIVE HOURS! It may be long but the actors did well memorizing their lines. So I recommend that you shoud start this movie somwhere between Daylight and the afternoon."
Positive,"I loved this movie/mini series. I've watched it time and again. I've always wondered about the soundtrack..I just CANNOT find it anywhere. (There is a link on amazon music..waiting for the seller to respond if what he/she has is the real thing) If anyone knows where to get the soundtrack, pls do send me a mail.ThanksChet"
Negative,"I teach The Odyssey, and let me tell you, this movie does NOT reflect the book well, if you're watching it for testing purposes (and I know you are!) However, I DO show selected scenes (out of sequence because the movie is out of sequence) just because my students think it's fun. WHEN will a GOOD version be made??? I had such hopes for Troy, and meh....My students' favorite part is the inexplicable arm action of the guard who announces ""Tele-machos of Ithaka!"" Scenery WILL be chewed - even the usually OK Greta Scacci comes off rather poorly."
Very Negative,"haha . . . wow this is one of those movies that is so completly bad that its funny. ok 1st of all Odysseus accent changes in almost every scene. 2nd penelope pronounces telemachos different than Odysseus. 3rd telemachos sounds like a whiney english boy. 4th posiedon ""the god of the wine dark sea"" is a face in a wave. 5th anitkleia is just freaky. 6th Odysseus beard changes color. 7th the cow scene wasnt even in there. 8th THEY NEVER LET PENELOPE HAVE HER REVENGE! 9th telemachos cant do any thing but then amazingly he can throw 2 spears at once. 10th Aoilos sounds like a cartoon. 11th the characters are all supposed to be bueatiful but they are all ugly . . . and i can go on. NOTEBOOMS 1/2 ROX! haha SPACE NEEDLE!"
Very Negative,"This movie was very boaring. I really didnt enjoy it at all. It was to gory. I just dont enjoy when people kill. I also dont enjoy when people dress like old stone age, and dont enjoy the anceint times they were rough and crewl times. The movie the odyssey took place in Greece back thousands of years ago when there was such things as mythical creatures. I really dont enjoy things like that others might. Although , there is a part I did like. I enjoyed the part of the movie when calypso(Venessa Williams) kept odysseus on the island for two years she nor her maids had not seen a man for 100 years. I thought that was very interesting. The other parts of the muvie confuse me and the names confuse me such as: Penelope(Greta Scacchi), Athene(Isabella Rossellini), Cyclopes(Reid Asato), and Eurybates(Ron Cook). Those were just a few. So all in all I would give this movie one star. I f you like movies like this then its great and go watch it but if you dont its not a movie for you as you can see."
Very Negative,"They sent the wrong part, its been 21 days and not resolved. Thier 1-800 # will not let you talk to any one. I left messages and no response. I real close to file a complaint with the BBB. Dont buy.LB"
Positive,"Great book for reading Psalms in our times. It uses words and phrases which make some of them very pertinent to today. If read in conjunction with reading the same verses in the Bible, it opens up new thoughts. Especially the 23rd Psalm."
Positive,"i have read all of Wilbur's books and found that one learns a lot about Africa (with a few exceptions). you learn african history, economics, social problems, environmental problems, natural history, etc. in this one, you learn about the diamond industry and the history of the Namibian diamond coasts, while Wilbur weaves it into his ""unputdownable"" story. kind of like the Master of the Game with substance. for an even better look at Namibian history, try the Burning Shore."
Positive,"This novel was written over 30 years ago. It is not as polished as his newer books but it contains all the elements that make Smith one of the masters of action and adventure. Exotic locale, unforgettable characters and a prose that takes you `there'.Let Wilbur take you to a trip to Africa, you will be coming back for more."
Very Negative,"When I order a book I expect a Book 6x9 inches, what I received was an shrunken facimily 4x7 trying very hard to make it to the major leagues. I would send it back but it would cost more than the imitation is worth."
Positive,"I prefer this update to the Gregory Peck version, although I could wish it had been more faithful to the original book. My question is this: the original television special was 4 HOURS LONG. Even allowing for commercial time, there had to have been at least 3 hours of film. Now, the running time of the DVD is 2hrs 25 minutes, and the video is even shorter; What happened to the rest of the material?!"
Very Negative,So disappointing! How could a movie made 40 years later be so much worse than the original? Patrick Stewart was great as Ahab but that's where the compliments end. The rest of the characters are played by rank amateurs or completely miscast. The whaling scenes are worse than the original ones and the ice-breaking scene was almost comical. I was glad to see the actors put out of their misery at the end.
Very Positive,The classic epic film adaptation of a great story of good vs. evil. A real nailbighter.
Very Negative,"Quite often, bringing a classic story like ""Moby Dick"" to the screen is a thankless task. But at least John Huston's 1956 version has a lot of class as well any number of great performances (even Moby Dick looked a lot more realistic in 1956!). This version just doesn't make it - skip it and buy a copy of Gregory Peck's rendition instead. You'll be glad you did."
Negative,This heater was used in a playroom in the basement. I loved the wheels because I could easily put it away when the kids were in the room. But the smell of oil was so strong I decided to return it. I called DeLonghi customer service and they told me any oil filled heater will smell like oil - especially when in the MAX setting.
Very Negative,"This product is useful, I guess, if you have a very small enclosed area to heat, as it gives off only a very modest amount of heat even when set as high as it goes. It is not, as advertised, cheap to run. In fact it cost me as much as the gas bill for my entire apartment without reducing that gas bill more than a couple of dollars. It is made on the cheap. The plug doesn't even have a ground pole. I inadvertently bumped into it one day causing it to pull against the wall plug and fried both the wall plug and the heater's plug. I haven't used either since. I'm sorry I wasted my money on this product. I suggest you save yours."
Very Negative,This is an absolutely not useful book. It is not understood at all and it is written so that no body can understand it but the author himself. So I do not recommend for you to buy it. Please save your money.TM
Positive,"It is everything I want and need. The cord length is generous. And, because it is corded, the performance is reliable and greater than a wireless mouse. Additionally, because it is corded it does not require batteries.I give the quality 5 stars because, it was a problem fee(plug and play)install and its precise tracking.I am happy with my purchase and would recommend it to others."
Neutral,I started reading Ann Perry's Pitt series in 2005. It's a good read. The Pitts are safe. The Monk's series is dark and intriguing. I love Monk! He is so courageous and does what it takes to get the truth. I hope Perry allows him to get his full memory or at least 80% back.
Neutral,"Old school Van Damme. It's a fun watch, but he's the bad guy which means that he doesn't get a whole heck-uva-lot of screen time. If you want a good old school Van Dammage stick with ""Blood Sport"""
Very Negative,"I had used this product at the urging of the pet store clerk. He claimed he had over 20 ferrets and at one time had a flea problem. I vacuumed, sent the dog to the groomers for a flea dip, then came home and sprayed the entire house. I returned after a few hours, opened the widows and started up the air conditioners and picked up the dog. The next day I noticed several adult fleas, though they were sluggish. I thought..great! Then the family started getting bites and seeing small and adult fleas. I feel I wasted my money for a product that seemed to give us 24hrs of relief. Forget the claim that it keeps on acting for up to 7 mos. I am not infested with fleas, but we still have them.....and they are alive and well."
Positive,"Hallows Eve are often overlooked and they were one of the more interesting metal bands to emerge in the early-mid 80's. Not really consisdered thrash in the truest sense they were more equal parts Venom(Death Metal) and Hardcore Punk probably drawing from some of the anarchist bands of the time (Ie-Crucifix). Remember this came out in 85 and very few bands other than Venom, Celtic Frost and the thrash faction of punk (ie: DRI)were doing anything this extreme. Highly recommended."
Positive,"In the years when my friends were sneaking peeks at ""Peyton Place"", I was secretly devouring ""The Foxes of Harrow"". This was after seeing the B-movie version starring Rex Harrison and Maureen O'Hara. To me it was every bit as good as ""Gone With the Wind"" and has stuck with me lo these many years. FYI, Frank Yerby had his picture on the jacket of my aunt's Book Club edition, quite interesting for that time, as other readers have pointed out."
Negative,"Over the years I've bought several Dionne Warwick albums that I've listened to with great enjoyment. I find this particular excursion, however, a sad disappointment. It just doesn't work. The instrumentals almost seem like parodies of Vegas back-up arrangements. Miss Warwick sounds as if she is out of her element. And the sound quality is mediocre. Ms. Warwick is a singer that I respect and admire. But this particular album does little to burnish her legacy."
Very Positive,"Diane Lane is great is this nicely crafted story set in the beautiful Tuscan country side. After watching the DVD extra's where the director talked about how it rained the entire time they filmed this in Italy I had to go back and watch it again - what a great job disguisung bad weather.This is just a nice story with no bad language, no violence and lots of gorgeous scenery."
Very Positive,"I loved this film so much. It is one of the best romantic comedies I have seen and the acting by Diane Lane was incrdeible. The scenery was fabulous and the movie is infused with fun, comedy and drama. A great movie. A stunning masterpiece of the genre. 5 stars."
Very Negative,"I love her books so much! This movie is an absolute insult! The original story was so wonderful I can't understand why the film makers thought they were making something better. And Ed! What about Ed? Geez. I could only get through the part where they were taking out the wall between the two rooms, foolishly thinking that the movie would get better, and after that I was done. Another good thing about DVDs is that you don't have to be kind and rewind. It would have be a waste of electricity and my VCR. This movie is right up there with Ishtar! Except worse!"
Very Negative,This movie was terrible. If there was an option for - stars I would go there.Read the book it's much more entertaining!
Negative,"Not bad entertainment...but the book is better, at least according to my wife who chose the movie after reading the book."
Positive,This movie was well paced and entertaining. The actors were good and the setting and great. Good chic or couples movie.
Neutral,"Although the movie offers stunning cinematography, and a rich travelogue view of Tuscany, the story disappoints. Diane Lane, ever the remarkable actress, portrays a woman who finds herself still empty and lonely, no matter how much adventure she has taken on and no matter how much she accomplishes after setback and heartbreak. If she doesn't find herself another man and a live-in permanent lover, everything is for nought. ..."
Very Positive,"Okay, I am a sucker for traveling, adventure, love stories, good wine and well, Italian trees too. After watching this film, you'll have an attitute like why not and move to Italy, buy a house, fill it up with people, make them your family... This movie gives a good life perspective to thouse who are found at some kind of dead end. It is kind of like an ice breaker of our society. Portrays very well how many people can live in darkness not realize that happiness is just within reaching of hand. Just like the character of the story, stuck in San Fransisco, mild town, with grey streets and boring, busy people, who only mind their own business. She is dipressed...not until she goes to Italy and radically changes her life by making a sudden choice that most people in San Fransisco would name mad!"
Positive,Diane Lane gives a great performance in this romantic/fantasy driven movie. I know many people dream of going to another place to escape the pressures of daily life and this movie does that for you. If you like romantic movies in a far away land then this movie is for you.
Positive,"Yes, you get lovely views of Tuscany and yes, she is renovating a run down villa. Otherwise, it is pretty much a new story. For those who loved the book, just make that mental adjustment and start with a fresh slate and you will enjoy the parallel blossoming in the movie of the woman and her house.I took off one star since it put my husband to sleep, but I found it a pleasant enough romance with good scenery. The main character is lovely and the various subplots such as the Polish laborer romancing a local girl expands the story to pull in the younger audience, I presume."
Negative,"Beautiful Scenery. Beautiful People. Thin Plot. Diane Lane is gorgeous in this film and her performance was excellent - she just needed a better script to work with. Her friendship with the men who remodel her house is one of the good things in the film. Much of the rest of the film is just too much escapism for me. Why do movies seem to always portray the solution to pain and heartache as running away and starting a new life? I would think that if I was hurting - the last thing I would want is to be thousands of miles away from my closest friends and family. And in a new culture, where I didn't speak the language?"
Very Positive,Pop the popcorn. Open a bottle of wine. Call your girlfriends and to come over and watch this movie and have a little party. This is a great girl movie!! Diane Lane is great in this movie and it really is all about her....and she carries this movie so well. You will enjoy meeting the people that come in and out of her life on her journey through life and her journey to Tuscany. Call your friends and let this movie entertain you!!
Neutral,"Only worth it for the Italian actor Raoul Bova who gives life to Marcello, who has a love affair with Frances. Like it's every day that you escape from your boring life and dull husband to encounter a man as gorgeous as this one in a faraway country, huh! Bova must be the most beautiful man on earth."
Negative,"One of the biggest disappointments I have seen in some time. My main complaint is when I see a theatrical trailer for a movie, and that rrailer implies the movie is a comedy, and then the movie does not deliver what the trailer seems to have promised, I hit the ceiling.There are characters in this movie who's inclusion makes no sense since they don't advance the plot and don't really come off as amusing either.The whole premise of buying a house in a foreign country in which you barely speak the language makes no sense either.I don't know -- maybe it's me -- it seems like the time would have been better spent watching a travel film on Tuscany.Ho-HUM!!"
Negative,"So-so at it's best. Great scenery. Good-looking men, but so typically ""chick-flick"" despite the true story. Diane Lane's character is a disillusioned divorcee who takes a trip to Italy and on a whim decides to buy a house in the local area. Intitially, there is frustration as the maintenance and upkeep of the house becomes overwhelming, but in time, her curious neighbors become very close friends and she eventually becomes intertwined in their cheerful lives. In a country where love and passion is so rampant, why does she feel so lonely? When wil her true amore come into her life?Cute flick, but not much depth to the story with very typical characters. The cinematography is lovely, though. Great flick for an empty afternoon."
